# Series 7 Exam Study Guide

## Equity Securities

### Common Stock
- First issue for all corporations
- Basis of company capitalization

### Treasury Stock
- Stock reacquired by the corporation
- Characteristics:
  * Pays no dividends
  * Has no voting rights

### Dividends
- Types:
  * Cash dividends
  * Stock dividends
- Important dates:
  * Declaration date (set by board)
  * Record date (determines eligible shareholders)
  * Payable date (when dividend is paid)
  * Ex-dividend date (Ex-date)
    - Set by Uniform Practice Code
    - One business day prior to record date
    - First date stock trades without dividend attached

### Dividend Calculations and Taxation
- Current yield = Annual dividend ÷ Current market price
- Cash dividends are taxable
- Dividends paid from one corporation to another: 50% tax excludable

### Stock Splits and Stock Dividends
- Not taxable events
- Require cost basis adjustment
- Identifying in questions:
  * Look for more shares at a lower price
  * Total value remains constant

## Preferred Stock

- Preferential treatment in:
  1. Dividends
  2. Liquidation
- Types:
  * Straight (non-cumulative)
  * Cumulative
- Considered equity but behaves like fixed income
- Suitability more similar to bonds:
  * Interest rates up → Preferred stock price down
  * Interest rates down → More likely to be called

## Rights and Warrants

### Rights
- Short-term
- Exercisable below current market price
- Given to existing shareholders to maintain proportional ownership

### Warrants
- Long-term
- Exercisable above current market price

## Bonds

### Key Concepts

  1. Interest rate risk
  2. Credit risk
- Inverse relationship: Interest rates ↑ → Bond prices ↓ (and vice versa)

### Yield Calculations
- Nominal yield (coupon rate)
- Current yield
- Yield to maturity (YTM)
- Yield to call (YTC)
  * Use for bonds trading at a premium

### Bond Pricing
- Premium: Price > Par
- Par: Price = Par
- Discount: Price < Par

### Trading Characteristics
- Trade over-the-counter (OTC) in negotiated quote-driven market
- Bond point = $10 (1% of par)
- Minimum spreads:
  * Corporate and municipal bonds: 1/8
  * Treasury bonds: 1/32

### Types of Bonds

#### Corporate Bonds
- Secured:
  * Mortgage bonds
  * Collateral trust bonds
  * Equipment trust certificates

  * Debentures
  * Subordinated debentures
  * Income/adjustment bonds

## Options

### Basic Strategies
1. Long call
2. Short call
3. Long put
4. Short put

### Advanced Strategies
5. Straddle
6. Spread (debit or credit)

  * Calls: Strike price + premium
  * Puts: Strike price - premium
- Maximum gain and loss for each strategy
- Intrinsic value vs. Time value

### Covered Call Strategy
- Generate income on existing long stock position
- Limits upside potential

### Protective Put Strategy
- Provides downside protection for long stock position
- Acts like insurance

## Retirement Plans

- 72: Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) start

### ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act)
- Covers private pension plans
- Does not cover municipal plans

### Types of Plans

- IRAs and Roth IRAs

### Taxation
- Most plans use pre-tax money (except Roth)
- Withdrawals generally taxed as ordinary income
- 10% penalty for early withdrawals (pre-59½)

## Margin

### Regulation T
- Initial requirement: 50%
- Customers get T+4 to pay for purchases

### Maintenance Requirements
- Long positions: 25% minimum
- Short positions: 30% minimum

### Calculations
- Long margin equation: Long Market Value - Debit = Equity
- Short margin equation: Credit Balance - Short Market Value = Equity

## Trading Securities

## Technical Analysis

- Support and resistance levels
- Head and shoulders pattern (bullish/bearish reversal signal)

## Fundamental Analysis

### Balance Sheet Ratios
- Working capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
- Current ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities
- Quick ratio (Acid test) = (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities

### Income Statement Analysis
- P/E ratio = Price per share ÷ Earnings per share
- Dividend payout ratio = Dividends per share ÷ Earnings per share

## Important Timeframes

- T+1: Government securities and options settlement
- T+2: Regular way settlement for most securities
- T+4: Regulation T payment period for customers
- 15 calendar days: Return of options agreement
- 30 calendar days: Wash sale rule
- 60 days: IRA rollover period
- 13 months: Letter of intent period for mutual fund breakpoints

## Key Percentages

- 0.25%: Maximum charge for no-load funds

- 25%: Minimum maintenance for long margin accounts
- 30%: Minimum maintenance for short margin accounts
- 50%: Initial margin requirement (Reg T)
