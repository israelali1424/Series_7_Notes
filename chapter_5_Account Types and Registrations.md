Let me know if I missed any key details from the lecture.
**Depreciation**
An accounting procedure, governed
by the IRS, that spreads the cost of a
tangible asset over its useful life.
Depreciation is the reduction in the
monetary value of an asset due to
everyday wear and tear. It is measured
using specific accounting procedures,
and in principal the process spreads the
cost of an asset, such as construction
equipment or a vehicle, over that assetâ€™s
useful life, as determined by IRS rules.
