## Options Trading Strategies

### 1. Protective Put
A **protective put** is an options strategy used to guard against potential losses in an existing stock position.

- **Purpose**: To protect against a decline in the stock price.
- **How it works**: You own a stock and you buy a put option on the same stock.
- **Example**: If you own 100 shares of XYZ stock currently trading at $50, you could buy a put option with a strike price of $45. This way, if the stock drops below $45, you can still sell it at $45, limiting your losses.

### 2. Covered Call
A **covered call** is a popular options strategy where you sell call options against stock you already own.

- **Purpose**: To generate additional income from the stock you hold.
- **How it works**: You own a stock and sell a call option on the same stock.
- **Example**: If you own 100 shares of XYZ stock currently trading at $50, you could sell a call option with a strike price of $55. You receive the premium from selling the option, and if the stock price goes above $55, you might have to sell your stock at that price.

### 3. Uncovered Call (Naked Call)
An **uncovered call**, also known as a naked call, is a high-risk strategy where you sell call options without owning the underlying stock.

- **Purpose**: To generate income from the premium received by selling the call option.
- **How it works**: You sell a call option without owning the stock.
- **Example**: If you sell a call option for XYZ stock with a strike price of $55 while not owning the stock, and the stock price goes above $55, you would have to buy the stock at the market price to deliver it to the call buyer, which could lead to significant losses if the stock price rises significantly.

### 4. Other Types of Options Trades

#### a. Long Call
A **long call** is buying a call option, giving you the right to buy the underlying stock at a specific price within a specific time period.

- **Purpose**: To profit from an anticipated increase in the stock price.
- **Example**: You buy a call option for XYZ stock with a strike price of $50. If the stock price rises to $60, you can buy the stock at $50 and sell it at $60.

#### b. Long Put
A **long put** is buying a put option, giving you the right to sell the underlying stock at a specific price within a specific time period.

- **Purpose**: To profit from an anticipated decrease in the stock price.
- **Example**: You buy a put option for XYZ stock with a strike price of $50. If the stock price falls to $40, you can sell the stock at $50.

#### c. Short Put (Naked Put)
A **short put** involves selling a put option without holding a short position in the underlying stock.

- **Purpose**: To generate income from the premium received by selling the put option.
- **Example**: If you sell a put option for XYZ stock with a strike price of $45 and the stock remains above $45, you keep the premium. However, if the stock drops below $45, you might be obligated to buy the stock at $45, which could result in a loss.

#### d. Vertical Spread
A **vertical spread** involves buying and selling two options of the same type (both calls or both puts) with different strike prices but the same expiration date.

- **Purpose**: To limit risk while still allowing for potential profit.
- **Example**: You buy a call option for XYZ stock with a strike price of $50 and sell a call option with a strike price of $55. This limits both your potential profit and loss.

#### e. Straddle
A **straddle** involves buying both a call and a put option for the same stock, with the same strike price and expiration date.

- **Purpose**: To profit from significant price movement in either direction.
- **Example**: You buy a call and a put option for XYZ stock with a strike price of $50. If the stock price moves significantly up or down, you can profit from the option that gains value.

#### f. Iron Condor
An **iron condor** involves selling a lower-strike put and a higher-strike call, and buying an even lower-strike put and an even higher-strike call.

- **Purpose**: To profit from low volatility in the stock price.
- **Example**: You sell a put with a strike price of $45 and a call with a strike price of $55, and buy a put with a strike price of $40 and a call with a strike price of $60. This strategy profits if the stock price remains between $45 and $55, with limited risk on either side.
