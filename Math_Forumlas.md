Here are notes on the formulas and math needed for the SIE exam, based on the transcript, in markdown format with some visual aids:

# SIE Exam Math and Formulas

## Balance Sheet Calculations

### Working Capital
```
Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
```

### Quick Assets
```
Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory
```

### Current Ratio
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
```

### Quick Ratio (Acid Test Ratio)
```
Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities
```

### Debt to Equity Ratio
```
Debt to Equity Ratio = Long-term Debt / Total Capitalization
```
Where:
- Total Capitalization = Long-term Debt + Shareholder Equity

## Stock and Bond Calculations

### Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio
```
P/E Ratio = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share
```

### Dividend Payout Ratio
```
Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividends Per Share / Earnings Per Share
```

### Current Yield
For stocks:
```
Current Yield = Annual Dividend / Current Market Price
```

For bonds:
```
Current Yield = Annual Interest / Current Market Price
```

## Option Calculations

### Call Option Breakeven
```
Breakeven = Strike Price + Premium
```

### Put Option Breakeven
```
Breakeven = Strike Price - Premium
```

### Straddle/Combo Breakevens
```
Upside Breakeven = Strike Price + Total Premium
Downside Breakeven = Strike Price - Total Premium
```

### Call Spread Breakeven (CAL)
```
Breakeven = Lower Strike Price + Net Premium
```

### Put Spread Breakeven (PUSH)
```
Breakeven = Higher Strike Price - Net Premium
```

## Margin Calculations

### Long Position Market Value at Maintenance
```
Market Value at Maintenance = Debit Balance / 0.75
```

### Short Position Market Value at Maintenance
```
Market Value at Maintenance = Credit Balance / 1.3
```

### Long Margin Equation
```
Equity = Long Market Value - Debit Balance
```

### Short Margin Equation
```
Equity = Credit Balance - Short Market Value
```
