The Official Notice of Sale is used for municipal securities offerings. It contains detailed information regarding the bidding procedures for a proposed new issuance of municipal bonds.

The date of sale in a competitive offering is the date on which all bids for the purchase of securities must be submitted to the issuer. In a negotiated sale, this is the date when the final contract to purchase the securities is executed.

### Qualified Legal Opinion

**Definition:**

- A **qualified legal opinion** is issued by a bond counsel that indicates there may be some legal uncertainty or potential issues regarding the validity or tax-exempt status of a municipal bond. This contrasts with an **unqualified legal opinion**, which states that the bond counsel has found no problems with the bond's legality or tax status.

**Key Points:**

1. **Legal Uncertainty:**
   - The bond counsel has identified potential legal issues or ambiguities that could affect the bond.
2. **Impact on Investors:**

   - Investors may perceive a qualified legal opinion as a higher risk compared to an unqualified opinion, potentially affecting the bond's marketability and interest rates.

3. **Reasons for Qualification:**

   - Potential litigation, unclear tax-exempt status, issues with the authorization or issuance process, or other legal complications.

4. **Disclosure:**
   - The qualified legal opinion must be disclosed to potential investors and typically accompanies the bond's offering documents.

### Example:

- A municipality issues bonds to finance a new project. The bond counsel provides a legal opinion but includes qualifications due to ongoing litigation regarding the project's environmental impact. This qualification must be communicated to investors as part of the bond offering.

### Summary:

- A **qualified legal opinion** indicates potential legal uncertainties with a municipal bond, which must be disclosed to investors and may affect the bond's marketability and perceived risk.


Competitive underwritings are initiated by the official notice of sale which invites interested firms to submit sealed bids, which include the underwriting scale. Issuers generally choose the winning bid based on the lowest net interest cost.
