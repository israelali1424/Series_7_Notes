Here are the key points about municipal bonds from the notes:

I. Types of Municipal Bonds
   A. General Obligation Bonds (GO Bonds)
      - Used to finance non-revenue producing municipal projects (libraries, city halls etc.)
      - Repaid from general tax revenues of the municipality
   B. Revenue Bonds
      - Used to finance revenue-producing projects (airports, bridges with tolls etc.)
      - Repaid from revenues generated by the project facility

II. Tax Treatment
   - Municipal bond interest income is exempt from federal income tax
   - If bonds are issued in-state, the interest is also exempt from state/local taxes ("triple tax-free")
   - Capital gains on muni bond sales are still taxable

III. Key Terminology
   A. Statutory Debt Limits - Limits on how much debt a municipality can issue, based on property value
   B. Adjacent Debt - When multiple issuers jointly raise capital for a project spanning their areas
   C. Co-terminus Debt - When issuers tax the same property (e.g. city and county)
   D. Overlapping Debt - Includes adjacent and co-terminus debt situations
   E. State Debt - Does not overlap since states don't tax property  

IV. Revenue Bond Features
   A. Not subject to statutory debt limits (based on project revenues)
   B. Trust Indentures with Covenants (promises to bondholders)
   C. Double-Barrel Bonds - Backed by project revenues and taxes
   D. Moral Obligation Bonds - State can, but not legally obligated, to pay from taxes
   E. Housing Authority Bonds - Backed by federal government if project revenues insufficient

V. Muni Bond Insurance
   - Insurance company guarantees principal and interest payments if issuer defaults
   - Insured bonds delivered with proof of insurance

VI. Investor Suitability 
   - Most suitable for investors in high tax brackets to benefit from tax-exemption
   - For AMT payers, recommended public purpose munis over private activity munis

Based on the notes, here are the key points about call provisions and prefunding for outstanding bonds:

I. Call Protection Period
- Outstanding bonds typically have a call protection period
- During this time, the issuer cannot "call" or redeem the bonds before maturity, even if interest rates have dropped

II. Prefunding to Refinance
- If interest rates drop significantly after bond issuance, issuers may want to refinance to take advantage of lower rates
- However, outstanding bonds are subject to the call protection period

III. Prefunding Steps:
1) Issue new bonds at current lower interest rates
2) Use proceeds from new bonds to redeem/pay off old higher interest rate bonds when the call protection period ends

IV. Downside of Prefunding
- Until call protection ends, issuer has to make interest payments on both:
   - The outstanding higher interest rate bonds 
   - The newly issued lower interest rate bonds used for prefunding
- This increases interest costs for the issuer in the interim period before calling the old bonds

V. Calculation
- Issuer has to calculate if the interest savings from the lower rates justifies paying dual interest payments during the prefunding period until call

So in summary, prefunding allows issuers to effectively refinance outstanding bonds despite call protection, by issuing new lower interest bonds and using proceeds to pay off the old bonds when permitted. But it comes at a temporary dual interest cost until the call date arrives.

Repurchase agreements add reserve balances to the banking system. This action gives banks more money to lend, so the costs of borrowing money (interest rates) goes down.


A repurchase agreement, commonly known as a "repo," is a form of short-term borrowing primarily used in the government securities market. It involves the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the same securities at a later date, typically at a higher price. The difference between the sale price and the repurchase price represents the interest paid for the loan, known as the repo rate


- **Equity-Linked Notes (ELNs):**
  - Typically issued by an investment bank as a form of debt security.
  - **Principal Protection:** Offers protection of the principal amount invested.
  - **Payouts:** Based on the performance of an underlying security or index.
  - **Credit Quality:** Payouts also depend on the credit quality of the issuer.


The conversion price for a bond is found by taking par value and dividing it by the conversion ratio. $1,000 / 40 shares = $25

102 ¾ means 102.75. Therefore, the municipal bond is trading at 102.75% of par. 102.75% x $1000 par = $1027.50
Note: only TREASURIES are quoted as 1/32, so you will not need to multiply ¾ by 1/32.
