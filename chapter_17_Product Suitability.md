## Unit Three, Chapter 17: Product Suitability Concepts

### Portfolio Analysis

#### Asset Allocation

Asset allocation is the distribution of a portfolio across stocks, bonds, and cash. Modern portfolio theory suggests that portfolios with diversified, non-correlated assets produce the best risk-return profile by limiting volatility.

- **Volatility:** Portfolios with less volatility, fewer wild swings, provide a better risk-return outcome. 
- **Diversification:** Combining assets that do not move together (non-correlated) can smooth out the ride. 

#### Risk Spectrum and Client Objectives

1. **Speculative Objectives (High Risk):**
   - Seek outsized returns with significant risk.
   - Investments: Penny stocks, selling options contracts, direct participation programs.

2. **Growth Objectives:**
   - Focus on long-term appreciation.
   - Riskier because returns are expected in the future, with no immediate income.

3. **Income Objectives:**
   - Seek current income, such as dividends or interest payments.
   - Lower risk because regular income reduces overall risk.

4. **Tax-Free Income:**
   - Generate income without tax liabilities, often through municipal bonds.
   - Generally safer investments.

5. **Liquidity Objectives:**
   - Immediate access to funds for short-term goals (2-3 years).
   - Investments need to be easily liquidated to cash.

6. **Preservation of Capital (Low Risk):**
   - Ensure no decline in account value.
   - Lowest returns but provide certainty and safety.

### Asset Allocation Examples

- **Conservative Allocation:**
  - Stability-focused.
  - Example: 75% bonds, 15% stocks, 10% cash.

- **Moderate Growth Allocation:**
  - Balance between growth and income.
  - Example: 60% bonds, 35% stocks, 5% cash.

- **Aggressive Growth Allocation:**
  - Long-term horizon, high risk.
  - Example: 90% stocks, 8% bonds, 2% cash.

### Rule of Thumb for Allocation

- **Age-Based Allocation:**
  - Your age in percentage is allocated to bonds.
  - Example: 20 years old → 20% bonds, 80% stocks; 90 years old → 90% bonds, 10% stocks.

### Modern Portfolio Theory

- **Objective:** Construct a portfolio providing the greatest return for a given level of risk.
- **Key Concepts:**
  1. **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):**
     - Calculates return based on risk taken, assuming no specific risk, only market risk.
  2. **Beta:**
     - Measures volatility compared to the overall market.
     - High beta: More volatile than the market.
     - Low beta: Less volatile than the market.
  3. **Alpha:**
     - Measure of returns exceeding expected risk-adjusted returns.
     - Alpha indicates a manager's ability to outperform given the risk taken.
