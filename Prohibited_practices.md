Gun Jumping 
No offer to sell securities is allowed by the issuer during the pre-filing period. If an offer to sell includes conditioning the public mind or arousing public interest, it may be considered gun-jumping. A gun-jumping violation also may occur by making projections during the quiet period, after the registration is filed
