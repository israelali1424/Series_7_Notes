Based on the passage, here are the key points about the different types of equities covered:

I. Common Stock
   - Represents ownership in the company
   - Shares can appreciate or depreciate in value
   - Pays dividends at discretion of board of directors  
   - Provides voting rights to elect board members
   - If traded over-the-counter (OTC) and under $5/share, considered a **penny stock**

II. Preferred Stock
    - Also represents ownership, but different from common stock
    - Primary aim is to provide fixed stream of dividends (income production)
    - Typically no voting rights
    - Little focus on share appreciation
    - Can have features like cumulative, participating, callable etc.

III. Rights
    - Give shareholders short-term ability to purchase stock from issuer at set price
    - Issued with new securities offerings to avoid dilution of ownership
    - Also called preemptive rights or subscription rights

IV. Warrants  
    - Gives holder right to purchase common stock at fixed price
    - Long-term instruments, issued with another security like bonds
    - Considered an equity security  

V. American Depository Receipts (ADRs)
    - U.S. traded security representing shares in a foreign company
    - Provides exposure to international equities while trading domestically
    - Denominated in U.S. dollars
    - Carries currency risk and political risk from foreign market

    II. Preferred Stock
A. Participating Preferred
- Offers possibility of higher dividend than stated rate
- Holders can "participate" in company's growth/profits
B. Callable Preferred
- The issuer has the right to "call" or redeem the shares
- To compensate investors, callable preferred pays higher dividend rate
C. Convertible Preferred
- Prices will be closely linked to the issuer's common stock price
- Holders have the option to convert to common shares
III. Rights
- Issuing preemptive rights likely leads to decrease in earnings per share (EPS)
- If combined with a stock split, rights provide twice the shares at half the price post-split
IV. Warrants
- No additional details provided
V. ADRs
- Taxed in same manner as U.S. stocks for capital gains and dividends
- Foreign country may withhold taxes on dividends paid, for which U.S. holder gets a tax credit

**dividend Taxation**
To obtain qualified dividend status on a common stock, the stock must be held for more than 60 days during the 121-day period surrounding the ex-dividend date. Since didn't hold the stock for 60 days the dividend will be taxed as nonqualified, at the same rate as ordinary income.


An investor may use up to $3,000 per
year of net capital losses to reduce
ordinary income. Note that there is no
limit to the amount of capital losses than
can be used to offset capital gains.

- **Tender Offer for Common Stock:**
  - If an investor is participating in a tender offer for a companyâ€™s common stock, they **may not** purchase common shares of the same issuer in the open market during the tender period.
  - The investor **is allowed** to purchase non-convertible securities of the issuer during the tender period.


- **A) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)**: This measure is calculated before subtracting interest and taxes. It does not take into account preferred dividends or the number of shares outstanding.

- **B) Net cash flow**: This represents the cash generated by the company's operations, minus capital expenditures and other investments, and is not directly related to the calculation involving preferred dividends and earnings per share.

- **C) Earnings per share (EPS)**: To calculate EPS, you subtract the preferred dividends from net income to find the income available to common shareholders. This figure is then divided by the number of outstanding common shares.

- **D) Price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio)**: This ratio is calculated by dividing the current market price per share by the earnings per share. It does not involve subtracting preferred dividends.

To enhance the return of Dennis's portfolio, which consists of shares of five computer companies, you might suggest:

**D) execute a debit spread using computer stocks.**

**Explanation**:

- **A) Buy a put on a narrow-based index**: Buying a put option is a bearish strategy used to hedge against potential declines in the value of an index. It does not directly enhance the return of a portfolio but rather provides protection.

- **B) Sell a call on a narrow-based index**: Selling a call option on an index can generate income through premiums but limits potential upside gains if the index rises significantly. This strategy is generally used to generate income rather than enhance returns.

- **C) Buy a straddle on a broad-based index**: A straddle involves buying both a call and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date, expecting significant price movement. This strategy may not be directly relevant to enhancing returns in Dennis's portfolio of computer stocks.

- **D) Execute a debit spread using computer stocks**: A debit spread involves buying and selling options on the same underlying asset, which can be a way to potentially profit from anticipated price movements in computer stocks while limiting risk. This strategy aligns well with enhancing returns by taking advantage of price movements within Dennis's specific sector.

**Conclusion**: Executing a debit spread using computer stocks can be an effective way to enhance the return of Dennis's portfolio by taking advantage of price movements within his specific sector.

So, the correct answer is **D) execute a debit spread using computer stocks**.


To calculate the value of the inverse ETF after the market moves, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Investment**: $25,000

2. **Market Rise on Tuesday**: +6%
   - The ETF, being an inverse ETF, will move in the opposite direction: -6%
   - ETF Value after Tuesday: 
     \[
     25,000 \times (1 - 0.06) = 25,000 \times 0.94 = 23,500
     \]

3. **Market Fall on Wednesday**: -3%
   - The ETF will move in the opposite direction: +3%
   - ETF Value after Wednesday: 
     \[
     23,500 \times (1 + 0.03) = 23,500 \times 1.03 = 24,205
     \]

**Conclusion**: The value of the ETF after the market changes is **$24,205**.

So, the correct answer is **B) $24,205**.
