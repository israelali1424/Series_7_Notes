### Short Sales and Short Margin Accounting

#### Overview of Short Sales
- **Definition**: Sale of stock that the seller does not own.
- **Account Requirement**: Must occur in a margin account.
- **Market View**: Bearish (hope for stock price to decrease).

#### Short Sale Process
- **Stock Borrowing**: Short seller borrows shares from a stock lender (typically a broker-dealer).
- **Sale**: Short seller sells borrowed shares to a buyer.
- **Cash Receipt**: Buyer pays cash for securities (e.g., $5,000 for 100 shares at $50/share).
- **Future Obligation**: Short seller must return shares to the stock lender at a later date.

#### Short Margin Balance Sheet

- **Components**
  - **Credit Register (Left Side)**
    - Cash in the account
    - Comprises:
      - Sale proceeds
      - Reg T deposit (50% of sale value)

  - **Short Market Value (Upper Right Side)**
    - Current market value of securities to be purchased
    - Also called "cost to close"

  - **Equity (Lower Right Side)**
    - Customer's net worth in the account

- **Key Differences from Long Margin**
  - Short market value on upper right (vs. long market value on left)
  - Credit register (pile of cash) instead of debit register

- **Regulatory Requirements**
  - **Reg T**: Set at 50%
  - **FINRA Minimum Maintenance**: 30% (higher than 25% for long positions due to increased risk)

#### Numerical Example

- **Initial Short Sale**
  - 1,000 shares of XYZ shorted at $60
  - **Short Market Value**: $60,000
  - **Equity Required (Reg T)**: $30,000 (50% of $60,000)
  - **Credit Register**: $90,000 ($60,000 sale proceeds + $30,000 Reg T deposit)

- **Balance Sheet Changes**
  - **Credit Register**: Only changes with customer action
  - **Short Market Value**: Updates daily based on current stock price
  - **Equity**: Recalculated based on Credit Register and Short Market Value

#### Scenarios

1. **Stock Price Decreases to $50**
   - **Short Market Value**: $50,000
   - **Equity**: $40,000
   - **Reg T Requirement**: $25,000
   - **FINRA Minimum**: $15,000
   - **Excess Equity (SMA)**: $15,000

2. **Stock Price Increases to $75**
   - **Short Market Value**: $75,000
   - **Equity**: $15,000
   - **Reg T Requirement**: $37,500
   - **FINRA Minimum**: $22,500
   - **Account Status**: Restricted and subject to maintenance call

- **Maintenance Call Calculation**
Formula
CopyMaximum Short Market Value = Credit Register ÷ 1.3
Example

Credit Register: $90,000
Maximum Short Market Value before maintenance call: $69,230

# Margin Trading: Short Sales and Margin Requirements

## Short Sales

### Account Type Required
- **Margin Account**: Short sales must be conducted in a margin account

### Margin Requirements for Short Sales

1. **Initial Margin**
   - **Reg T**: 50% of the market value
   - **FINRA**: $2,000 minimum
   - **Actual Requirement**: Greater of Reg T or FINRA minimum

2. **Maintenance Margin**
   - **Long Positions**: 25% of market value
   - **Short Positions**: 30% of market value
   - Note: Firms can set higher requirements

## Margin Requirements by Investment Amount

### Long Margin Accounts

| Investment Amount | Margin Requirement |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| $0 - $2,000       | 100% (FINRA rule)   |
| $2,000 - $4,000   | $2,000 flat amount  |
| $4,000+           | 50% (Reg T)         |

### Short Margin Accounts

| Investment Amount | Margin Requirement |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| $0 - $2,000       | $2,000 flat amount  |
| $2,000 - $4,000   | $2,000 flat amount  |
| $4,000+           | 50% (Reg T)         |

## Marginable Securities

- Securities traded on exchanges
- OTC securities approved by Federal Reserve
- Warrants
- LEAPS options (75% initial and maintenance margin)

## Non-Marginable Securities

- OTC issues not approved by Federal Reserve
- Standard options (≤ 9 months to expiration)
- Rights
- New issues (first 30 days)
- Mutual funds

+-------------------+-------------------+
```

### Components
- **Long Market Value**: Current value of owned stocks
- **Debit Register**: Fixed loan amount from broker
- **Equity**: Customer's net worth (LMV - DR)

### Daily Calculations
- Reg T: 50% of Long Market Value
- FINRA Minimum Maintenance: 25% of Long Market Value

## Excess Equity and SMA

- **Excess Equity**: Equity above current Reg T requirement
- **SMA (Special Memorandum Account)**: Line of credit equal to excess equity
  - Provides 2x buying power or 1x withdrawal power
  - High water mark feature

## Key Takeaways

1. Short sales require margin accounts and have stricter requirements
2. Margin requirements vary based on investment amount and account type
3. Daily mark-to-market adjustments ensure compliance with regulations
4. Understanding excess equity and SMA is beneficial but may not be heavily tested


# Margin Trading: Advanced Concepts and Calculations

## Stock Price Appreciation Scenario

### Initial Position
- 1,000 shares of ABC at $40
- Long Market Value (LMV): $40,000
- Debit Register (DR): $20,000
- Equity: $20,000

### After Appreciation to $50
- New LMV: $50,000
- DR: $20,000 (unchanged)
- New Equity: $30,000

### Calculations
- Gain: $10,000 ($30,000 - $20,000)
- Return on Investment: 50% ($10,000 / $20,000)
- Reg T: $25,000 (50% of $50,000)
- Minimum Maintenance: $12,500 (25% of $50,000)
- Excess Equity: $5,000 ($30,000 - $25,000)
- SMA (Special Memorandum Account): $5,000

## Using SMA

### Option 1: Cash Withdrawal
- Withdraw $5,000 cash
- New DR: $25,000
- New Equity: $25,000
- No change in LMV

### Option 2: Buy More Stock
- Buy $10,000 worth of stock
- New LMV: $60,000
- New DR: $30,000
- New Equity: $30,000

## Key Points on SMA
- Stock Buying Power: 2:1 ratio
- Cash Withdrawal: 1:1 ratio
- High water mark feature
- Can be used in restricted accounts, but not below minimum maintenance

## Restricted Accounts

### Conditions
- Equity falls below Reg T requirement
- No immediate action required

### Restrictions
1. New purchases require full Reg T deposit
2. 50% of sale proceeds must reduce loan

## Maintenance Margin Call

### Trigger
- Equity falls below FINRA minimum maintenance (25% of LMV)

### Options
1. Deposit cash to meet minimum
2. Firm may sell securities (4x maintenance call amount)

## Calculating Lowest Allowable LMV

### Formula
```
Lowest LMV = Debit Register ÷ 0.75
```

### Example
- DR: $25,000
- Lowest LMV: $33,334 ($25,000 ÷ 0.75)
- At this point, Equity would be exactly 25% of LMV

## Key Takeaways
1. Margin amplifies gains and losses
2. SMA provides additional buying power or withdrawal ability
3. Restricted accounts have limitations but don't require immediate action
4. Maintenance calls require prompt action to avoid forced liquidation
5. Understanding the lowest allowable LMV helps anticipate potential margin calls

## Numerical Example

### Initial Short Sale
- 1,000 shares of XYZ shorted at $60
- Short Market Value: $60,000
- Equity Required (Reg T): $30,000
- Credit Register: $90,000 ($60,000 sale proceeds + $30,000 Reg T deposit)

### Scenario 1: Stock Price Decreases to $50
- Short Market Value: $50,000
- Equity: $40,000
- Reg T Requirement: $25,000
- FINRA Minimum: $15,000
- Excess Equity (SMA): $15,000

- Equity: $15,000
- Reg T Requirement: $37,500
- FINRA Minimum: $22,500
- Account Status: Restricted and subject to maintenance call

## Maintenance Call Calculation

### Formula
```
Maximum Short Market Value = Credit Register ÷ 1.3
```

### Example
- Credit Register: $90,000
- Maximum Short Market Value before maintenance call: $69,230

## Key Takeaways

1. Short selling is considered riskier than long positions
2. Balance sheet structure differs from long margin accounts
3. Regulatory requirements are stricter (higher FINRA minimum)
4. Maintenance calls occur when equity falls below FINRA minimum
5. Understanding both long and short margin accounting is important, but focus on areas most likely to be tested

SMA stands for Special Memorandum Account. It is a term used in the context of margin accounts, which are accounts that allow investors to borrow money from their brokerage to buy securities. Here's an explanation suitable for the Series 7 exam:

Special Memorandum Account (SMA)
Definition: An SMA is a line of credit in a margin account that represents the excess equity available for the investor to borrow against or use to buy more securities.
Purpose: It provides additional purchasing power for investors without having to deposit more funds into the account.
Calculation:
SMA is created when the market value of securities in the margin account increases, resulting in excess equity.
It can also be increased by cash dividends, interest payments, or additional deposits made by the investor.
Uses:
Investors can use SMA to buy more securities on margin.
It can be withdrawn as cash.
Limitations:
Using SMA increases the investor's debt balance and, consequently, the interest cost.
The use of SMA is still subject to initial margin requirements and maintenance margin requirements.
Regulations:
The Federal Reserve’s Regulation T governs the use of SMA, setting initial margin requirements.
FINRA and other regulatory bodies set maintenance margin requirements.
Important Considerations:
The balance in the SMA does not decrease when the market value of the securities falls, but the purchasing power can be reduced if the equity in the account falls below the required maintenance margin level.
SMA does not represent cash available in the account but rather the buying power or borrowing potential.


### Special Memorandum Account (SMA)

**Definition:**
- The **Special Memorandum Account (SMA)** is a line of credit in a margin account that represents the amount of excess equity available. It allows the investor to borrow additional funds or to meet margin calls without depositing additional cash.

**Key Points:**
1. **Creation of SMA:**
   - SMA is created when the equity in a margin account exceeds the initial margin requirement. This excess equity can be used to purchase additional securities or withdrawn as cash.

2. **Maintenance of SMA:**
   - The SMA balance remains in the account even if the equity falls below the initial margin requirement, unless used.

3. **Usage of SMA:**
   - The investor can use the SMA for new purchases or to cover margin calls. Using SMA increases the debit balance and decreases the equity in the account.

4. **Effect of Price Changes:**
   - SMA does not decrease if the market value of securities declines, but it can increase with appreciation in the value of securities or additional deposits.

### Example Scenario:

**Given:**
- A client purchases $60,000 of ABC stock in her new margin account and pays for the shares in full.

**Calculation:**
- Since the client pays for the shares in full, the purchase does not create any margin loan. Thus, there is no borrowing, and the entire $60,000 is covered by the client’s cash deposit.

**SMA Result:**
- In this scenario, because the client pays in full, there would be no immediate SMA created as there is no excess equity derived from a margin loan. SMA typically arises from excess equity when margin is used for purchasing securities.

### Summary:
- **SMA** represents the available line of credit in a margin account from excess equity.
- When a client pays for a purchase in full in a new margin account, no initial SMA is created since there is no margin loan or excess equity involved.
