# Municipal Bonds Study Guide

## I. Floating Rate vs. Fixed Rate Municipal Bonds

### Floating Rate Municipal Bonds (FRMBs):
- Interest rate adjusts periodically based on market rates
- **Benefit:** Maintains stable price as it reflects current market rates
- **Drawback:** Doesn't offer high initial interest rates like some fixed-rate bonds

### Fixed Rate Municipal Bonds:
- Interest rate is set at issuance and remains constant until maturity
- **Benefit:** May offer higher initial interest rates than FRMBs
- **Drawback:** Price can fluctuate if market rates change

## II. Build America Bonds (BABs)
- Taxable municipal bonds with a federal tax credit that offsets the federal tax liability on the interest earned
- **Benefit:** Makes them suitable for a wider range of investors, not just high-tax-bracket ones

## III. When-Issued Municipal Bonds
- Bonds sold before the official issuance date
- **Key Characteristic:** Interest rate is already determined while other details like settlement date and accrued interest are unknown

## IV. Municipal Bond Features Compared

| Feature | Revenue Bond | General Obligation (GO) Bond |
|---------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Debt per capita | Not a major concern | Important - impacts statutory debt limit |
| Unfunded pension liabilities | Important - competes for tax dollars used for bond service | Not a major concern |
| Income taxes | Not a major concern | Local municipalities rely on property taxes |

## V. Municipal Bond Trading
- Primarily conducted **over-the-counter (OTC)** between dealers, not on exchanges
- **Reasons for Lower Trading Activity:**
  - Investors buy for tax-free income, not capital appreciation
  - Municipal bonds are issued by many localities, reducing overall trading volume

## VI. Municipal Bond Quotes
- **Serial Bonds:** Quoted on a yield-to-maturity basis (longer maturity = higher yield)
- **Dollar Price Quotes:** Represent a percentage of par value
- **Nominal/Subject Quotes:** Not firm commitments to buy/sell at the quoted price

## VII. Municipal Bond Lot Sizes
- **Round Lot:** $100,000 (typically comprised of 100 $1,000 par value bonds)

## VIII. Broker Anonymity in Municipal Bond Trades
- Brokers used to hide investor identity in the OTC market
- Trades still reported to the Real-Time Reporting System (RTRS) within 15 minutes

## IX. Tax-Equivalent Yield Calculations
- Used to compare taxable corporate bond yields to tax-free municipal bond yields
- Formula: Municipal Yield / (1 - Tax Bracket) = Tax-Equivalent Yield

## X. Auction Rate Securities (ARS)
- Long-term debt securities with interest rates reset periodically through auctions
- Interest rates are tied to short-term rates

 Mutual Fund share types
   ***Share Classes: A, B, and C**
   Class A Shares
   Sales Charge: Upfront sales charge.
   Breakpoints: Available for reduced sales charges, especially for larger investments.
   12b-1 Fees: Typically lower.
   Regulatory View: Favored for long-term ownership.
   Class B Shares

   Breakpoints: Not available.
   Regulatory View: Generally considered less cost-effective for long-term ownership compared to Class A shares.

Exchanges or conversions allow investors to exchange shares of one fund for an equivalent investment in another fund of the same family. There are no redemption fees on the redeemed shares or sales charges on the new shares. However, the exchange is a taxable event, and any gain or loss must be reported. The number of exchanges in a year may also be limited.
