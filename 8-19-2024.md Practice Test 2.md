The correct procedure that ensures the delivery of securities is made only if proper payment is secured from the customer is:

**C) delivery versus payment (DVP).**

**Explanation**:
- **Delivery versus Payment (DVP)**: This is a settlement procedure where the delivery of securities occurs only if payment is made simultaneously. This method is often used in institutional trading to minimize the risk of non-payment.

The other options:
- **A) Regular way settlement**: This refers to the standard settlement period, typically T+2 days, but does not specifically ensure that payment is secured at the time of delivery.
- **B) Delayed settlement**: This involves extending the settlement date beyond the normal period but doesn’t relate to securing payment at delivery.
- **D) Seller's option delivery**: This allows the seller to determine the delivery date within a specified period, but it doesn't ensure payment upon delivery.



The type of bond most likely to be purchased through competitive bidding is:

**B) General obligation bonds.**

**Explanation**:
- **General Obligation Bonds**: These are municipal bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing municipality, meaning they are secured by the issuer's ability to levy taxes. When municipalities issue general obligation bonds, they often use a competitive bidding process to ensure they get the best possible interest rates. Under competitive bidding, multiple underwriters submit bids, and the bond is sold to the underwriter offering the lowest interest cost to the issuer.

The other options:
- **A) Corporate Bonds**: These are typically issued through a negotiated sale rather than competitive bidding.
- **C) Income Bonds**: These bonds pay interest only if the issuing company has sufficient earnings. They are less common and usually not issued through competitive bidding.
- **D) Debentures**: These are unsecured corporate bonds typically sold through a negotiated process rather than competitive bidding.

So, the correct answer is **B) General obligation bonds.**

In this scenario, the investor has sold an ABC April 55 Put and an April 60 Call. Here's what each term means:

An investor has sold an ABC April 55 Put and an April 60 Call. The investor has executed a:

**C) Short Combination.**

**Explanation**:
- **A) Debit Spread**: This involves buying and selling options of the same type (either calls or puts) with different strike prices or expiration dates. Since the investor has sold both a put and a call, this does not qualify as a debit spread.

- **B) Long Straddle**: This involves buying both a call and a put with the same strike price and expiration date. Here, the investor has sold, not bought, options and has different strike prices and expiration dates.

- **C) Short Combination**: This involves selling a call and a put option on the same underlying asset with different strike prices and/or expiration dates. The investor has sold an April 55 Put and an April 60 Call, which fits this definition.

- **D) Covered Call**: This involves holding a long position in a stock and selling a call option on the same stock. Since the investor has sold both a put and a call and not a call alone, this does not fit the description of a covered call.

So, the correct answer is **C) Short Combination.**

A "collar" is an options strategy designed to limit both potential gains and losses. It involves:

- **Long stock**: Holding a position in the underlying security.
- **Long puts**: Purchasing put options to provide downside protection.
- **Short out-of-the-money calls**: Selling call options to generate income, which helps offset the cost of buying the puts and limits the upside potential.

Given this description, the correct answer is:

**D) Long stock, long puts, short out-of-the-money calls on the same security.**


Concerning the alternative minimum tax (AMT), the most accurate statement is:

**D) An individual may be subject to the AMT in one year and not the following year.**

**Explanation**:
- **A) Individuals with lower incomes are more likely to be impacted by the AMT**: The AMT primarily affects individuals with higher incomes who have significant deductions or tax preferences, not necessarily those with lower incomes.

- **B) The AMT was created by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to ensure all investors file their income tax returns by April 15 each year**: The AMT was created to ensure that taxpayers with high deductions and income, who could otherwise avoid paying taxes, still pay a minimum amount of tax. It is not related to filing deadlines.

- **C) The interest income from a public purpose (school) municipal bond is subject to the AMT**: Interest income from private activity bonds (which could include certain school bonds) might be subject to AMT, but interest from general public purpose municipal bonds is generally not subject to AMT.

- **D) An individual may be subject to the AMT in one year and not the following year**: This is true as AMT liability can vary based on changes in income, deductions, and tax credits, so an individual might be subject to AMT in one year and not in another.

So, the correct answer is **D) An individual may be subject to the AMT in one year and not the following year.**


To determine how much SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation) will cover in the event of the bankruptcy of a broker-dealer, you need to understand what SIPC insurance covers:

### SIPC Coverage Basics
- SIPC protects customers against the loss of cash and securities (up to $500,000 per customer, including a $250,000 limit for cash).
- SIPC coverage is for the net equity of the account, which is calculated as the value of securities minus any margin debit balance.

### Calculate Net Equity
- **Total Securities Value**: $650,000
- **Debit Balance**: $275,000
- **Net Equity**: $650,000 - $275,000 = $375,000

### SIPC Coverage Amount
- SIPC will cover the net equity up to $500,000 per customer. Since the net equity is $375,000, which is less than $500,000, SIPC would cover the entire amount.

**Conclusion**: SIPC will cover **$375,000** in the event of the bankruptcy of the broker-dealer.

So, the correct answer is **A) $375,000.00**.

The term that describes the number of times by which the annual net revenues of a facility exceed the annual interest charges and principal payments is called the:

**C) Debt Service Coverage Ratio**

**Explanation**:
- **A) Working Capital Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay off its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. It is not related to the coverage of debt service.

- **B) Dividend Payout Ratio**: This measures the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders, not the ability to cover debt service.

- **C) Debt Service Coverage Ratio**: This ratio measures a company's ability to service its debt with its net operating income. It is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Debt Service Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Operating Income}}{\text{Debt Service (Interest + Principal Payments)}}
  \]
  This ratio indicates how many times the company’s income can cover its debt obligations.

- **D) Collection Ratio**: This typically measures how effectively a company collects its receivables, not related to debt service.

So, the correct answer is **C) Debt Service Coverage Ratio**.


The agency with the ultimate authority for determining the amount of the discount on original issue discount (OID) municipal bonds is:

**A) IRS**

**Explanation**:
- **A) IRS**: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is responsible for the tax treatment of original issue discount (OID) bonds. They provide the rules and guidelines for how the discount should be calculated and reported for tax purposes.

- **B) FRB**: The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) does not have authority over the tax treatment of OID bonds.

- **C) SEC**: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates securities markets and securities transactions but does not set tax rules for OID bonds.

- **D) MSRB**: The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) regulates municipal securities but does not determine the tax discount on OID bonds.

So, the correct answer is **A) IRS**.


The price of a convertible bond tends to be more volatile than other types of debt when:

**D) Equity valuations are increasing.**

**Explanation**:
- **A) Interest rates are less stable**: While interest rate volatility can impact bond prices, convertible bonds are more influenced by equity price movements than by interest rate changes alone.

- **B) Interest rates are more stable**: When interest rates are stable, the volatility of convertible bonds is more influenced by changes in the underlying stock price.

- **C) The yield curve is flat**: A flat yield curve impacts the bond market in general, but it does not specifically address the volatility of convertible bonds.

- **D) Equity valuations are increasing**: Convertible bonds have an equity component (conversion feature) that makes their prices more sensitive to changes in the value of the underlying stock. When equity valuations are rising, the value of the conversion feature increases, leading to greater volatility in the convertible bond’s price.

So, the correct answer is **D) equity valuations are increasing**.


In a rights offering, existing shareholders are given the right to purchase additional shares of the company's stock at a discounted price. The impact of this event typically includes:

- **A) Decrease in the outstanding shares**: This is not correct. A rights offering actually increases the number of outstanding shares because new shares are issued to existing shareholders.

- **B) Increase in the book value**: This is not necessarily true. While the book value per share might change, the overall book value of the company can increase if the rights offering raises additional capital.

- **C) Decrease in the earnings per share**: This is often correct. The issuance of additional shares generally leads to an increase in the number of shares outstanding, which can dilute earnings per share (EPS), assuming net income remains the same.

- **D) Increase in corporate profits**: The rights offering itself does not directly impact corporate profits. It raises capital, but the effect on profits will depend on how the raised funds are used.

**Conclusion**: The most likely impact of a rights offering is a **decrease in the earnings per share** due to the dilution effect.

So, the correct answer is **C) decrease in the earnings per share**.

According to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), a control relationship exists between a municipal broker-dealer and an issuer when:

**C) An officer of the underwriter is in a position of authority over the issuer of the municipal bonds.**

**Explanation**:
- **A) Senior officers of the municipal dealer live in the municipality**: The residency of senior officers does not create a control relationship.

- **B) The firm recently completed a negotiated underwriting for the municipality**: Completing a negotiated underwriting does not by itself establish a control relationship.

- **C) An officer of the underwriter is in a position of authority over the issuer of the municipal bonds**: This establishes a control relationship because it indicates a significant level of influence or authority over the issuer by the underwriter.

- **D) The dealer has an inventory of the issuer's bonds that are trading at a premium**: Holding inventory of bonds does not indicate a control relationship.

**Conclusion**: A control relationship is defined by the influence or authority one party has over the other, which in this case is indicated by an officer of the underwriter holding a position of authority over the issuer.

So, the correct answer is **C) an officer of the underwriter is in a position of authority over the issuer of the municipal bonds**.

To determine the breakeven point for this options position, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Net Premium Paid**:
   - **Sell 1 XYZ Nov 55 Put** for 6.5 (receive premium).
   - **Buy 1 XYZ Nov 45 Put** for 3.5 (pay premium).
   - Net Premium Received = Premium Received - Premium Paid
   \[
   \text{Net Premium} = 6.5 - 3.5 = 3.0
   \]

2. **Determine the Breakeven Point**:
   - The breakeven point for a put spread is found by subtracting the net premium received from the strike price of the higher strike put (the put option that was sold).

   For this position:
   - Higher Strike Put (sold) = 55
   - Net Premium Received = 3.0
   - Breakeven Point = Strike Price - Net Premium Received
   \[
   \text{Breakeven Point} = 55 - 3.0 = 52.0
   \]

**Conclusion**: The breakeven point for this options position is **52**.

So, the correct answer is **B) 52**.


When a non-spouse inherits an IRA, the permitted options include:

**C) Transfer the assets into an inherited IRA, and distribute all proceeds within 10 years**

**Explanation**:

- **A) Transfer the assets into their personal IRA**: Non-spouses cannot transfer inherited IRA assets into their own personal IRA. Instead, they must set up an inherited IRA.

- **B) Transfer the assets into an inherited IRA, taking lifetime distributions over their life expectancy**: This was an option under the old rules, but the SECURE Act of 2019 changed the rules. This option is now generally available only to certain eligible designated beneficiaries, such as minor children or individuals who are disabled.

- **C) Transfer the assets into an inherited IRA, and distribute all proceeds within 10 years**: Under the SECURE Act, most non-spouse beneficiaries must withdraw all assets from the inherited IRA within 10 years of the original account holder's death.

- **D) Transfer the assets into an inherited IRA, and distribute all proceeds within 20 years**: This option is not generally permitted under the current rules. The 10-year rule is more common.

**Conclusion**: The correct options are **B** (for certain beneficiaries) and **C** (for most non-spouse beneficiaries under the SECURE Act).

So, the most widely applicable correct answer is **C) Transfer the assets into an inherited IRA, and distribute all proceeds within 10 years**.



In a discretionary account, where the registered representative has the authority to make investment decisions without prior approval for each trade, the rules generally require that certain procedures be followed when purchasing specific types of investments. For a limited partnership investment, which typically involves complex and potentially high-risk features, the following is required:

**C) With prior written consent of the client.**

**Explanation**:

- **A) With prior written consent of a supervisor**: While supervisory consent is generally required for certain transactions in discretionary accounts, specific investments such as limited partnerships also require client consent.

- **B) With prior written consent of the limited partnership sponsor**: Consent from the limited partnership sponsor is not required for the purchase of the partnership in a discretionary account. The key is client consent.

- **C) With prior written consent of the client**: For certain investments, particularly those that are illiquid or complex like limited partnerships, written consent from the client is required to ensure that the client is fully aware of and agrees to the investment.

- **D) Upon your decision that this product is suitable and appropriate for him**: Although suitability is important, you must also obtain the client's written consent for purchasing limited partnerships in their discretionary account.

**Conclusion**: For purchasing a limited partnership in a discretionary account, you must obtain the client's written consent.

So, the correct answer is **C) with prior written consent of the client**.


Upon receiving confirmation of a client's death, the correct procedure regarding any open orders being held by the firm is:

**C) must be cancelled with the account being subsequently frozen.**

**Explanation**:

- **A) Should be confirmed with the client's trusted contact person**: This is not a required step for handling open orders upon confirmation of death. The account should be frozen and open orders cancelled immediately without additional confirmation from a trusted contact.

- **B) Must be executed immediately and then the account should be frozen**: Orders should not be executed after the client's death. The account should be frozen and open orders cancelled.

- **C) Must be cancelled with the account being subsequently frozen**: This is the correct procedure. Upon confirmation of death, open orders should be cancelled, and the account should be frozen to prevent any further transactions until proper legal procedures are followed.

- **D) Should be cancelled following confirmation from the client's trusted contact person that these open orders should indeed be cancelled**: Open orders should be cancelled immediately upon confirmation of death, not waiting for confirmation from a trusted contact person.

**Conclusion**: The appropriate action is to cancel open orders and freeze the account upon confirmation of the client’s death.

So, the correct answer is **C) must be cancelled with the account being subsequently frozen**.


When the dividends on the preferred shares are subtracted from Alpha Corporation's net income and the resulting figure is divided by the outstanding shares, the result is Alpha's:

**C) earnings per share.**

**Explanation**:

- **A) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)**: This measure is calculated before subtracting interest and taxes. It does not take into account preferred dividends or the number of shares outstanding.

- **B) Net cash flow**: This represents the cash generated by the company's operations, minus capital expenditures and other investments, and is not directly related to the calculation involving preferred dividends and earnings per share.

- **C) Earnings per share (EPS)**: To calculate EPS, you subtract the preferred dividends from net income to find the income available to common shareholders. This figure is then divided by the number of outstanding common shares.

- **D) Price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio)**: This ratio is calculated by dividing the current market price per share by the earnings per share. It does not involve subtracting preferred dividends.

**Conclusion**: The calculation involving the subtraction of preferred dividends from net income and dividing by the number of outstanding shares results in earnings per share (EPS).

So, the correct answer is **C) earnings per share**.



Sam currently owns one DEF May 50 Call and one DEF May 50 Put. This position is known as a **straddle**, which profits from significant price movements in either direction.

**Sam's Belief:**

- **D) will be volatile in the near term.**

**Explanation**:

- **A) Stays the same**: A straddle profits from significant movements, not from a stable market.

- **B) Will reach a resistance level and then fall**: A straddle benefits from movements in either direction, not just a fall.

- **C) Will reach a support level and then rise**: Similarly, a straddle does not rely on predictions about support or resistance levels but rather on significant price changes.

- **D) Will be volatile in the near term**: This is correct because a straddle is designed to profit from volatility, regardless of the direction of the price movement.

**Conclusion**: Sam's position (a straddle) indicates that he believes the market will be volatile in the near term.

So, the correct answer is **D) will be volatile in the near term**.


When making a recommendation to an investor regarding a Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO), the least relevant factor among the options is:

**B) The taxable equivalent yield**

**Explanation**:

- **A) The quality of the underlying collateral**: This is very relevant because the performance of a CMO is directly affected by the quality of the mortgages backing it. Higher quality collateral generally reduces risk.

- **B) The taxable equivalent yield**: CMOs are typically not as concerned with taxable equivalent yield because CMOs are generally taxed as ordinary income rather than as municipal bond interest. The taxable equivalent yield is more relevant for municipal bonds versus other taxable investments.

- **C) Impact of interest rate changes**: Interest rate changes affect CMOs significantly because they can influence prepayment rates and the value of the mortgage-backed securities. This is a key factor in assessing the risk and return of a CMO.

- **D) Estimated average life and final maturity of the CMO**: Understanding the average life and final maturity is crucial for evaluating the CMO's cash flow characteristics and how it fits into the investor's investment horizon and liquidity needs.

**Conclusion**: The taxable equivalent yield is less relevant when evaluating a CMO compared to the other factors, which directly impact the performance and risk associated with CMOs.

So, the correct answer is **B) The taxable equivalent yield**.


One of the factors used to determine whether a 1035 exchange may be appropriate for an investor is the timing of any previous such exchanges. It is typically considered inappropriate for an investor to effect a 1035 exchange when a prior such transaction was conducted:

**B) within the past 36 months**

**Explanation**:

- **A) At least 36 months ago**: This is generally not a restriction; exchanges made at least 36 months ago are usually acceptable.

- **B) Within the past 36 months**: Many insurance companies and financial professionals consider it inappropriate to perform a 1035 exchange if the previous exchange occurred within the past 36 months due to potential tax implications, fees, or other considerations.

- **C) Within the past 12 months**: While this may be restrictive, the typical guideline is the past 36 months.

- **D) Four years ago**: A 1035 exchange conducted four years ago is generally outside the typical restriction period.

**Conclusion**: The correct answer is **B) within the past 36 months**.


To determine the sales proceeds per share upon the exercise of the put options, you need to account for the exercise price of the put options and the cost of purchasing those options. 

Here's the calculation:

1. **Exercise Price of Put Options**: $40 per share
2. **Cost of Put Options**: $3 per share (cost of purchasing each put option)

When you exercise the puts, you effectively sell the stock at the exercise price minus the cost of the put options.

### Calculation:

- **Exercise Price of the Put Option**: $40
- **Cost of the Put Option**: $3 (this is a reduction in the effective sales price because it was paid to acquire the right to sell at the strike price)

**Effective Sales Price** = Exercise Price - Cost of Put Option  
**Effective Sales Price** = $40 - $3  
**Effective Sales Price** = $37

**Conclusion**: For tax purposes, the sales proceeds per share upon the exercise of the puts are **$37**.

So, the correct answer is **B) 37**.


Following issuance, the least amount of after-market activity would likely be observed with a:

**A) Regulation D offering**

### Explanation:

- **A) Regulation D Offering**: Regulation D offerings are private placements and are typically sold to a limited number of accredited investors. Because these offerings are not registered with the SEC and are not publicly traded, there is generally less after-market activity and trading compared to public offerings.

- **B) Rule 147 Offering**: Rule 147 offerings are intrastate offerings where the issuer conducts the offering within one state. While these offerings are restricted to residents of that state, they can still be traded within that market, so there might be some after-market activity, but it's generally less than for national offerings.

- **C) Primary Offering of Equities**: Primary offerings involve the sale of new shares to the public and typically generate significant after-market activity as shares are bought and sold in the open market.

- **D) Secondary Offering of Debt**: Secondary offerings involve the sale of existing debt securities and usually generate more after-market activity as these securities are traded in the secondary market.

**Conclusion**: The least amount of after-market activity would likely be observed with a **Regulation D offering**.



The correct answer is:

**C) the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).**

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a widely used model that describes the relationship between the expected rate of return of an equity security and its risk, as measured by beta. CAPM helps in determining the appropriate required rate of return for an asset, taking into account its systematic risk relative to the market.

To calculate the current yield of the stock, you use the following formula:

\[
\text{Current Yield} = \left(\frac{\text{Annual Dividend}}{\text{Market Price per Share}}\right) \times 100
\]

Given:
- Quarterly dividend = $0.80
- Market price per share = $50

First, calculate the annual dividend:
\[
\text{Annual Dividend} = 0.80 \times 4 = \$3.20
\]

Now, calculate the current yield:
\[
\text{Current Yield} = \left(\frac{3.20}{50}\right) \times 100 = 6.4\%
\]

The correct answer is **B) 6.40%**.

- **Unlimited Tax Bonds**:
  - Backed by the total taxing authority of the issuer.
  - The issuer may use any type of tax within its authority as backing for these bond issues.

- **Referendums**:
  - Special votes required to authorize most local General Obligation (GO) issues.

- **Special Assessment Bonds**:
  - Backed by assessments paid by property owners who benefit from the improvements to the property.
  - Commonly used to fund sidewalks, water lines, and sewers.


- **Tax Authority Bonds**:
  - Bonds that are backed by the issuer's power to levy and collect taxes.
  - The issuer uses its taxing authority to ensure repayment of the bond.
  - The strength of the bond depends on the issuer's ability to collect sufficient taxes.
  - Often used by municipalities or other government entities to finance public projects.

A bond purchased at a premium is amortized (reduced) to par value over its life. The process used for amortization is the constant yield method on all bonds issued after 1985. The constant yield method results in a different amortization amount each year based on the bond's current yield to maturity and value.

Variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs) are usually issued with maturities of 20 -30 years, but are considered short term because of the put feature that allows investors to sell them back to the issuer at par on their interest rate reset dates. VRDOs provide good portfolio diversification because the interest rates have low correlation with those of stocks and bonds.
