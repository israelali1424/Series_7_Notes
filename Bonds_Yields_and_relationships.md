- When a bond is trading at a premium, CY is lower than NY, YTM is lower than CY, and YTC is lower than YTM.
- When a bond is trading at a discount, CY is higher than NY, YTM is higher than CY, and YTC is higher than YTM.
- When a bond is trading at par, NY, CY, YTM, and YTC are all equal.

### Nominal Yield (NY)
Nominal Yield, also known as the coupon rate, is the annual interest rate paid by the bond issuer based on the bond's face value (par value). It is a fixed percentage and does not change throughout the life of the bond.

**Example:** If a bond has a face value of $1,000  and a nominal yield of 5%, the bond will pay $50 in interest annually.

### Current Yield (CY)
Current Yield is a measure of the annual interest income relative to the current market price of the bond. It is calculated by dividing the bondâ€™s annual coupon payment by its current market price.

**Formula:** 
\[ \text{Current Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Current Market Price}} \]

**Example:** If the bond from the previous example (with a $50 annual coupon payment) is currently priced at $1,100, the current yield would be:
\[ \text{Current Yield} = \frac{50}{1100} \approx 4.55\% \]

### Yield to Maturity (YTM)
Yield to Maturity is the total return expected on a bond if it is held until it matures. It takes into account all coupon payments received over the life of the bond, as well as any capital gain or loss that occurs when the bond is redeemed at its face value. YTM is a complex calculation that solves for the interest rate that equates the present value of a bond's future cash flows to its current price.

**Example:** If you purchase a bond for $950 that has a face value of $1,000 and matures in 5 years, with an annual coupon payment of $50, the YTM calculation would consider all these factors to give you an annualized yield.

### Yield to Call (YTC)
Yield to Call is the yield of a bond if you were to buy and hold the security until the call date, before it matures. This is applicable for callable bonds, which can be redeemed by the issuer before they reach maturity. The YTC calculation is similar to the YTM calculation but assumes the bond will be called at the call date instead of held to maturity.

**Example:** If the bond in our previous example is callable in 3 years at $1,020, the YTC calculation would consider the bond's current price, the call price, the coupon payments until the call date, and the time to the call date to determine the yield.

These yield types help investors understand different aspects of bond returns and make more informed investment decisions based on their financial goals and market conditions.
