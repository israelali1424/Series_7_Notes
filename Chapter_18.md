 Total liabilities is equal to total assets minus shareholders' equity. Therefore, total liabilities must equal $500 million as total assets are $750 million and shareholders' equity is $250 million. The amount of net income for a given period cannot be determined based on the size of a company's total assets and shareholders' equity. A increase in sales would ultimately be captured on the balance sheet through net income and into retained earnings, however, that impact cannot be quantified given the information provided.
