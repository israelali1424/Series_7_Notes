Exempt transactions under the Securities Act of 1933 are crucial for certain entities to raise capital without undergoing the full registration process. These exemptions allow issuers to sell securities without registering them with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which can save time and resources. However, these exemptions come with specific conditions and limitations to protect investors.

Regarding your question, yes, an issuer can sell securities without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 through exempt transactions. This means they can avoid the full registration process and going public by utilizing one of the available exemptions.

Let's delve into some of the key exemptions you mentioned:

1. **Regulation A+ (Reg A+)**: This exemption is primarily designed for small businesses and startups to raise capital from the public without undergoing a full SEC registration. It provides two tiers of offerings with different requirements, allowing companies to raise up to a certain amount within a 12-month period.

2. **Regulation D (Reg D)**: Reg D provides exemptions from the registration requirements for certain private placements. It's commonly used for offerings targeting accredited investors or a limited number of non-accredited investors. There are different rules under Reg D, including Rule 504, Rule 505, and Rule 506, each with its own set of conditions and limitations.

3. **Rule 147 (Intrastate Offering Exemption)**: This exemption allows issuers to offer and sell securities only to residents of a single state without registering the offering with the SEC. It's intended to facilitate capital formation within a state's boundaries.

4. **Rule 144A (Qualified Institutional Buyer Exemption)**: Rule 144A allows for the resale of certain restricted securities to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) without SEC registration. This exemption is commonly used in private placements and secondary market transactions.

5. **Regulation S (Reg S)**: Reg S provides an exemption for offers and sales of securities made outside the United States, primarily targeting offshore investors. It's important for companies seeking to raise capital internationally while complying with U.S. securities laws.

Remembering these exemptions and their purposes is crucial for issuers and investors alike, as they provide avenues for capital raising while ensuring compliance with securities regulations.
