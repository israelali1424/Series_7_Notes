Here are the main points I captured from the introduction video lecture: 

I. Instructor Introduction:
- Mentioned to have helped you be able to get yourself to where you need to be. If you have a concern about that, you can say, well,
if you're accredited, you're making like 200 K or more a year. Your net worth is a million bucks,
or you're an institution with plenty of money. But if you're non-accredited, you
will be able to get yourself to where you need to be.
. Mentioned to have helped you be able to get yourself to where you need to be.
**Accredited Invetstor Reqs**
Officers and Directors:

Automatically considered accredited investors.
Employees:

Not automatically accredited unless they meet specific financial criteria.
Income Test:

Personal net income of $200,000 in each of the last two years.
Joint income of $300,000 in each of the last two years.
Reasonable expectation of meeting the same income level in the current year.
Asset Test:

Net worth of $1 million, excluding the value of the primary residence.
II. Have enough materials to study what law commits to.

III. Expectations about application of law:

1) Federal law commits to ongoing disclosures; common person commits to what they must say;
2) Federal law commits to oral summaries;
3) Federal law commits to open textbooks to illustrate and explain;
4) Federal law limits oral summaries;
5) Federal law commits to oral summaries;
6) Federal law commits all types of supplementary materials and resources;
7) Federal law commits when concepts are relevant and useful;
8) Federal law commits when concepts are non-routine;
9) Federal law commits to make the most accessible resource;
10) Federal law commits when concepts are unclear or inaccurate;
11) Incorrect answer

It seems to be asking for the third item, that the law is able to make relevant or useful supplementary materials to provide open access.

**QIB**
To be a QIB, an institution must control a securities portfolio of at least $100 million on a discretionary basis. Broker-dealers with securities portfolios of at least $10 million also are considered QIBs. All investors in a Rule 144A offering must be QIBs.
