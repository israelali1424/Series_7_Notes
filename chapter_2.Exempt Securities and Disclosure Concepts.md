Here are the main points I captured from the introduction video lecture: 

I. Instructor Introduction:
- Mentioned to have helped you be able to get yourself to where you need to be. If you have a concern about that, you can say, well,
if you're accredited, you're making like 200 K or more a year. Your net worth is a million bucks,
or you're an institution with plenty of money. But if you're non-accredited, you
will be able to get yourself to where you need to be.
. Mentioned to have helped you be able to get yourself to where you need to be.
**Accredited Invetstor Reqs**
Officers and Directors:

Automatically considered accredited investors.
Employees:

Not automatically accredited unless they meet specific financial criteria.
Income Test:

Personal net income of $200,000 in each of the last two years.
Joint income of $300,000 in each of the last two years.
Reasonable expectation of meeting the same income level in the current year.
Asset Test:

Net worth of $1 million, excluding the value of the primary residence.
II. Have enough materials to study what law commits to.

III. Expectations about application of law:

1) Federal law commits to ongoing disclosures; common person commits to what they must say;
2) Federal law commits to oral summaries;
3) Federal law commits to open textbooks to illustrate and explain;
4) Federal law limits oral summaries;
5) Federal law commits to oral summaries;
6) Federal law commits all types of supplementary materials and resources;
7) Federal law commits when concepts are relevant and useful;
8) Federal law commits when concepts are non-routine;
9) Federal law commits to make the most accessible resource;
10) Federal law commits when concepts are unclear or inaccurate;
11) Incorrect answer

It seems to be asking for the third item, that the law is able to make relevant or useful supplementary materials to provide open access.

**QIB**
To be a QIB, an institution must control a securities portfolio of at least $100 million on a discretionary basis. Broker-dealers with securities portfolios of at least $10 million also are considered QIBs. All investors in a Rule 144A offering must be QIBs.

Sure! Here are the condensed notes:

Records related to a Regulation D (private placement) offering must be maintained for three years from date of final use.

In a Regulation D 506 deal in which the
securities are publicly advertised, there
can be an unlimited number of
accredited, but zero non-accredited
investors. If there was no public
advertising, then there could have also
been 35 non-accredited investors.

The limit on control stock sales in a three-month period is the greater of 1% of outstanding shares or average weekly trading volume over the prior four weeks. In this case, it is the greater of 10,000 shares (outstanding) or 20,000 shares (volume). However, if the stock were traded on OTC Bulletin Board or Pink, only outstanding shares (not volume) would be considered and the limit would be 10,000 shares.


Private placements have several advantages over public offerings. For example, they can be brought to market faster with less regulatory red tape and legal cost, and they do not require registration statements or prospectuses. A major disadvantage is an increased cost of capital. With vast numbers of prospective investors in the public market, issuers can price their securities more competitively.
