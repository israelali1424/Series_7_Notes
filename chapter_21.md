The Direct Registration System is a service of the Depository Trust Corporation and enables shareholders to have their stock held in book-entry (electronic) form with the issuer, rather than holding physical certificates.


When a registered rep quotes a client
the incorrect price at which a transaction
is made, the client is still responsible for
the actual price where the trade was
executed.
