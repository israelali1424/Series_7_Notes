Here are very detailed notes on communications with the public in a format designed to be an effective study guide:

**Communications with the Public Study Guide**

_Three Categories of Communications & Requirements:_

**I. Retail Communications**

- Definition: Any written (including electronic) communication distributed to more than 25 retail clients/investors within a 30-day period
- Requirements:
  - Must be approved by a firm principal before use
  - Material changes require re-approval from principal
  - New FINRA member firms deploying public media communications (TV, radio, internet, billboards) must pre-file with FINRA 10 business days prior to first use
  - Retail communications containing unpublished/self-created performance rankings must be pre-filed with FINRA 10 days before use
- Examples:
  - Websites
  - Billboards
  - Online bulletin boards (but individual posts may be treated as correspondence)
  - Sales scripts used to solicit potential clients
- Notes:
  - Prospectuses are NOT considered retail communications, as they are issuer disclosure documents reviewed by regulators

**II. Correspondence**

- Definition: Any written communication distributed to 25 or fewer retail clients/investors within a 30-day period
- Does NOT require principal pre-approval
- Examples: Individual emails, individual posts on online bulletin boards
-Subject to review by Principal

**III. Institutional Communications**

- Definition: Communications sent exclusively to institutional investors (no retail investors)
- Do NOT require principal pre-approval
- Example: A monthly newsletter explicitly stating "For Institutional Investors Only"

_Other Key Points:_

**IV. Use of Personal Devices**

- Representatives are permitted to use personal devices for business communications
- However, it requires supervision and record retention of those communications

**V. Social Media Communications**

- Static posts are considered retail communications requiring principal pre-approval
- Interactive posts in real-time dialogue are treated as correspondence (no pre-approval needed)
- All social media communications must be retained for record keeping (3 years)

**VI. Research Reports**

- Not required to include price targets, but can choose to
- Equity research analysts can trade stocks they cover, but trading activity must be consistent with their rating/recommendation
- Firms can distribute 3rd party research reports, but must disclose preparing firm
- Disclosures required:
  - Percentage of all securities rated by the firm in each buy/hold/sell category
  - Percentage of each rating category that were investment banking clients in the past year
- "Quiet periods" when research is restricted:
  - 10 days for IPOs
  - 3 days for follow-on offerings

_Overarching Principles:_

- Regulators aim to balance investor protection with flexibility for firms
- Conflicts of interest are addressed through mandatory disclosures
- Requirements based on number of recipients, not content of communication
- More stringent rules for communications reaching a wider public audience


The three principles that apply to communication regarding variable products includes- the product being clearly identified as a variable product, the product cannot meet short term liquidity needs, and the communication cannot imply that the guarantee applies to an investment return. Most life insurance products do allow investors to take a loan against their cash balance if needed, which is why this is NOT a variable product communication principle.


 At least 40% of a mutual fund?s board of directors must be independent ? meaning that they do not have significant business relationships with the fund.

 Websites are considered retail communication and are subject to the same rules as all over forms of retail communication.
