Here's a study guide summarizing key tips and tricks for the Series 7 exam based on the lecture:

Series 7 Study Guide: Tips and Tricks

1. Mnemonics and Memory Aids:

• DERP vs DREP: DERP is about the secondary market (Date, Ex-dividend, Record, Payment)
• DIE 90: Dividends, Interest, Expenses - 90% must be passed through in sub-chapter M companies
• OPMC: Order, Purchase & Sales, Margin, Cashiering (clearing firm departments)
• PIGs and PALs: Passive Income Generators and Passive Activity Losses
• SLOBS: Sell Limit Orders and Buy Stops are placed above market price
• BAAC vs DAPP: Brokers Act As Agents for Commission vs Dealers Act as Principals for Profit
• CALL UP or PUT DOWN: For option breakevens
• CAL or PuSH: Call Add Lower, Put Subtract Higher (for spread breakevens)
• BULLS: Because you are Long the Lower Strike (for identifying bullish spreads)
• DEW or CEN: Debit spreads (Exercise, Widen) vs Credit spreads (Expire, Narrow)
• SILO: Short Inside, Long Outside (for straddles)
• EPIC: Exporters buy Puts, Importers buy Calls

2. Test-Taking Strategies:

• Read the full question (RTFQ) and all answer choices
• Consider reading the last sentence first for long questions
• Use process of elimination
• Look for mutually exclusive answer choices
• Apply the "Sesame Street trick" - spot the answer that doesn't fit
• Mark answers True/False if helpful
• Use "reduction to the ridiculous" for implausible answers

3. Key Concepts to Remember:

• Options matrix for understanding 6 basic strategies
• Teeter-totter concept for bond prices vs yields
• Uniform Practice Code and clearing firm operations
• Suitability considerations (e.g. passive income/losses)
• Basic formulas: current yield, parity, margin, breakevens

4. Data Dump Sheet:

• Consider creating a sheet with key formulas, mnemonics, and hard-to-remember facts
• Practice recreating your data dump sheet to memorize it
• Use it to "warm up" your brain before the exam

5. General Advice:

• Most Series 7 math involves division
• For spreads, gain/loss always equals difference in strikes
• Breakevens in spreads are always between the two strikes
• Be careful with "except" questions
• When in doubt, divide the first number by the second for many math problems

Remember to thoroughly learn the material, using these tips and tricks as supplements to your knowledge rather than replacements for understanding the concepts.
