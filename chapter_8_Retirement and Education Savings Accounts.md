#### Roth Model (e.g., Roth 401(k), Roth IRA, 529 Plan)

## 2. Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)

### Traditional IRA

| Age Range | Contributions | Distributions |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| 0-49 | Allowed | Not Allowed |
| 50-59.5 | Allowed + Catch-up | Not Allowed |
| 59.5-73 | Allowed + Catch-up | Allowed (taxed as ordinary income) |
| 73+ | Allowed + Catch-up | Required (taxed as ordinary income) |

### Roth IRA

| Age Range | Contributions | Distributions |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| 0-49 | Allowed | Not Allowed (except contributions) |
| 50-59.5 | Allowed + Catch-up | Not Allowed (except contributions) |
| 59.5-73 | Allowed + Catch-up | Allowed (tax-free) |
| 73+ | Allowed + Catch-up | Allowed but not required (tax-free) |

### Key Points
- **Earned Income Requirement**: Contributions to IRAs require earned income
- **Annual Contribution Limit**: Applies to the total of all IRA contributions (Traditional + Roth)
- **Early Distributions**: Pre-59.5 distributions are subject to ordinary income tax and a 10% penalty (with some exceptions)

## 3. Transferring Retirement Accounts

### Rollover Method
- Client takes possession of funds
- Only 80% of account value is received
- 20% withheld for taxes
- Must fully fund new account within 60 days
- Shortfall treated as early distribution (taxed + potential 10% penalty)
- Limited to once per year

### Transfer Method
- Direct transfer between custodians
- 100% of funds moved
- No withholding tax
- Client never takes possession of funds
- No limit on frequency

## 4. Inherited IRAs

### Spouse as Beneficiary
- Can **assume the IRA**
- Treated as their own IRA
- Normal IRA rules apply (contributions, distributions, RMDs)

### Non-Spouse Beneficiary
- **Inherited IRA** status
- **10-Year Method**: Must distribute entire account within 10 years of original owner's death
- No RMDs, but full distribution required by December 31st of year 10
- No 10% early withdrawal penalty
- Distributions taxed as ordinary income

### Key Considerations for Inherited IRAs
- Balance tax implications with growth potential
- Consider spreading distributions over time vs. lump sum


Certainly. I'll expand on each type of account mentioned in the overview. Let's break this down into more detail:

# Detailed Explanation of Tax-Advantaged Savings Accounts

## 1. Corporate Retirement Plans

### ERISA-Compliant Plans
**ERISA** (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) is a federal law that sets minimum standards for most voluntarily established retirement and health plans in private industry.

#### Examples of ERISA-Compliant Plans:
1. **401(k) Plans**
   - Employer-sponsored retirement savings plan
   - Employees can contribute pre-tax dollars
   - Often includes employer matching contributions
   - Annual contribution limits apply

2. **Pension Plans**
   - Employer-funded retirement plan
   - Promises a specified monthly benefit at retirement
   - Can be defined benefit (based on salary and years of service) or defined contribution (based on investment performance)

3. **403(b) Plans**
   - Similar to 401(k), but for public schools and certain tax-exempt organizations
   - Allows employees to invest in tax-sheltered annuities or mutual funds

### Non-Qualified Corporate Plans
These are plans that don't meet ERISA guidelines and are typically offered to high-level executives.

#### Examples:
1. **Deferred Compensation Plans**
   - Allows executives to postpone receiving a portion of their income
   - Tax is deferred until the money is received

2. **Executive Bonus Plans**
   - Employer pays premiums on a life insurance policy for the executive
   - Provides both life insurance and a source of retirement income

## 2. Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
### Traditional IRA
- Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on income and other factors
- Earnings grow tax-deferred
- Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income
- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) begin at age 73

### Roth IRA
- Contributions are made with after-tax dollars
- Earnings grow tax-free
- Qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free
- No RMDs during the owner's lifetime

## Key Differences and Considerations

### Corporate vs. Individual Plans

- Corporate plans may have higher contribution limits

### Traditional vs. Roth Accounts
- Traditional accounts offer immediate tax benefits but taxed withdrawals
- Roth accounts offer tax-free growth and withdrawals but no immediate tax benefit
- Choice often depends on current vs. expected future tax rates

### Education vs. Retirement Savings
- Education accounts are specifically for education expenses
- Retirement accounts have penalties for non-retirement withdrawals (with some exceptions)
- Some retirement accounts (like IRAs) can be used for education expenses without penalty, but may still be taxed

### Disability Savings
- ABLE accounts provide a tax-advantaged way for individuals with disabilities to save without affecting benefits eligibility
- Offer more flexibility in use of funds compared to traditional special needs trusts

Understanding these different account types allows individuals to choose the best savings strategy based on their specific needs, financial situation, and long-term goals.
