Here are the key points about municipal bonds from the notes:

I. Types of Municipal Bonds
A. General Obligation Bonds (GO Bonds) - Used to finance non-revenue producing municipal projects (libraries, city halls etc.) - Repaid from general tax revenues of the municipality
B. Revenue Bonds - Used to finance revenue-producing projects (airports, bridges with tolls etc.) - Repaid from revenues generated by the project facility

II. Tax Treatment

- Municipal bond interest income is exempt from federal income tax
- If bonds are issued in-state, the interest is also exempt from state/local taxes ("triple tax-free")
- Capital gains on muni bond sales are still taxable

III. Key Terminology
A. Statutory Debt Limits - Limits on how much debt a municipality can issue, based on property value
B. Adjacent Debt - When multiple issuers jointly raise capital for a project spanning their areas
C. Co-terminus Debt - When issuers tax the same property (e.g. city and county)
D. Overlapping Debt - Includes adjacent and co-terminus debt situations
E. State Debt - Does not overlap since states don't tax property

IV. Revenue Bond Features
A. Not subject to statutory debt limits (based on project revenues)
B. Trust Indentures with Covenants (promises to bondholders)
D. Moral Obligation Bonds - State can, but not legally obligated, to pay from taxes
E. Housing Authority Bonds - Backed by federal government if project revenues insufficient
**double-barreled=**
A double-barreled bond is a GO bond that is first backed by the full faith and credit and general revenues of the issuer, but can also rely on revenues of the project for payment of debt service. Because they can rely on two sources of funds for debt service, double barreled bonds are viewed as some of the safest municipal bonds.
V. Muni Bond Insurance

- Insurance company guarantees principal and interest payments if issuer defaults
- Insured bonds delivered with proof of insurance

VI. Investor Suitability

- Most suitable for investors in high tax brackets to benefit from tax-exemption
- For AMT payers, recommended public purpose munis over private activity munis

### Tax Swap and Wash Sale for the Series 7 Exam

**Tax Swap:**

**Definition:**
- A **tax swap** is a strategy used by investors to sell a security at a loss and purchase a similar, but not identical, security. The primary goal is to realize a capital loss for tax purposes while maintaining a similar investment position.

**Key Points:**
1. **Purpose:**
   - To realize a capital loss that can be used to offset capital gains and reduce taxable income.
   - To maintain an investment in the same sector or asset class.

2. **Execution:**
   - Sell a security that has decreased in value.
   - Purchase a similar security (not substantially identical) to maintain exposure to the market or sector.

3. **Rules:**
   - The securities involved in the swap should not be substantially identical to avoid wash sale rules.

4. **Example:**
   - Selling shares of one technology company at a loss and purchasing shares of another technology company with similar characteristics.

**Wash Sale:**

**Definition:**
- A **wash sale** occurs when an investor sells a security at a loss and repurchases the same or a substantially identical security within 30 days before or after the sale.

**Key Points:**
1. **Purpose:**
   - Often unintentional, the wash sale rule is designed to prevent investors from claiming a tax deduction for a security sold at a loss, only to repurchase the same or substantially identical security shortly thereafter.

2. **IRS Rule:**
   - The IRS disallows the capital loss deduction if the same or a substantially identical security is bought within 30 days before or after the sale.

3. **Substantially Identical:**
   - Includes not only the same security but also options or contracts to acquire the security, or securities that are convertible into the sold security.

4. **Holding Period:**
   - The holding period of the repurchased security includes the holding period of the original security.

5. **Disallowed Loss:**
   - The disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the repurchased security, effectively deferring the loss until the new security is sold.

6. **Example:**
   - Selling shares of a company at a loss on December 1st and buying back the same shares on December 20th. The loss cannot be claimed on that year's tax return.

### Summary for Series 7 Exam:

**Tax Swap:**
- Understand the concept of selling a security at a loss and purchasing a similar (but not substantially identical) security to maintain an investment position while realizing a tax loss.
- Recognize the importance of avoiding substantially identical securities to comply with IRS rules.

**Wash Sale:**
- Comprehend the wash sale rule and its implications on claiming tax losses.
- Identify what constitutes a substantially identical security and the 30-day period rule.
- Know the tax implications, including the disallowance of the loss and its adjustment to the cost basis of the repurchased security.

By understanding these concepts, candidates can effectively answer questions related to tax strategies and IRS rules on the Series 7 exam.


### Local Government Investment Pools (LGIPs)

**Definition:**
- LGIPs are equity securities similar to mutual funds. Investors own a proportionate share of the investment pool.

**Management:**
- The investment pool can be managed by government employees or an external investment firm.

**Purpose:**
- LGIPs were established to provide safe, liquid, and competitive investment options for cash held by municipalities.


- **Duration:**
  - **Definition:** A measurement of how long it will take for an investor to receive back their cash flows from a bond.
  - **Zero-Coupon Bonds:** Have a duration equal to their maturity. This is because the investor does not receive any interest payments until the bond's maturity date.

The flow of funds is critical information for analysis of revenue bonds. Analysis of GO bonds requires scrutiny of the debt statement which includes overlapping debt for which the municipality is responsible. Analysts will compare ratios to evaluate the financial health of the municipality, such as the net overall debt to assessed valuation ratio which compares the value of outstanding municipal bond issues to assessed property values.

Interest on municipal bonds is generally higher than US Government bonds because munis are considered less safe than government bonds. The interest payments on municipal bonds do not fluctuate; they are fixed at issue. If the interest on an outstanding bond is more than the coupon for similar new issues, the outstanding bond will trade at a premium; if less, the bond will trade at a discount. The interest on municipal bonds may be exempt if the bondholder lives in the state of issue only.

1. Certificate of Participation (COP):
Definition: A Certificate of Participation is a type of financing where an investor receives a share of the lease revenues from a specific project rather than a bond backed by the issuing municipalityâ€™s full faith and credit.
How It Works: Instead of issuing bonds to raise funds for a project, a government entity enters into a lease agreement and issues COPs. Investors who buy COPs are entitled to a portion of the lease payments made by the government entity.
Use: COPs are often used to finance public projects like schools, prisons, or other municipal facilities without needing voter approval, as would be required for traditional municipal bonds.
2. Double-Barreled Bond:
Definition: A double-barreled bond is a type of municipal bond that is secured by two sources of revenue.
How It Works: These bonds are backed both by the general taxing power of the issuing municipality (general obligation) and by revenues from a specific project (such as tolls from a highway or fees from a utility).
Use: The dual backing makes double-barreled bonds more secure and attractive to investors, as they have a reduced risk of default due to the two revenue streams.
3. Industrial Development Revenue Bond (IDRB):
Definition: An Industrial Development Revenue Bond is a type of municipal bond issued by a government entity to fund the construction or improvement of a facility for private use, typically by a corporation.
How It Works: The bond is secured by the lease agreement between the issuing municipality and the corporation that will use the facility. The corporation is responsible for making lease payments, which are used to pay the interest and principal on the bonds.
Use: These bonds are often issued to encourage economic development and job creation within the municipality. The interest income from these bonds is usually exempt from federal income taxes.
4. Revenue Anticipation Note (RAN):
Definition: A Revenue Anticipation Note is a short-term debt instrument issued by a municipality, typically with a maturity of one year or less.
How It Works: The purpose of a RAN is to provide the municipality with liquidity in anticipation of future revenue. The note is repaid once the anticipated revenue (such as taxes, grants, or other income) is received.
Use: RANs are commonly used to manage cash flow issues, allowing municipalities to cover expenses while waiting for revenue to come in.
These different types of bonds and securities are designed to meet various financing needs of municipalities and corporations, providing investors with a range of options based on their risk tolerance and investment goals.


The price of a variable rate bond remains relatively stable because the interest rate adjusts to prevailing conditions. As the name implies, the rate of interest paid will vary over the life of the bond. The amount of interest is tied to an underlying index, such as the rate on Treasury Bills. Lenders take on the interest rate risk because the interest payments they receive are subject to fluctuation.
