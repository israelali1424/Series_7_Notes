Here are the key points about municipal bonds from the notes:

I. Types of Municipal Bonds
A. General Obligation Bonds (GO Bonds) - Used to finance non-revenue producing municipal projects (libraries, city halls etc.) - Repaid from general tax revenues of the municipality
B. Revenue Bonds - Used to finance revenue-producing projects (airports, bridges with tolls etc.) - Repaid from revenues generated by the project facility

II. Tax Treatment

- Municipal bond interest income is exempt from federal income tax
- If bonds are issued in-state, the interest is also exempt from state/local taxes ("triple tax-free")
- Capital gains on muni bond sales are still taxable

III. Key Terminology
A. Statutory Debt Limits - Limits on how much debt a municipality can issue, based on property value
B. Adjacent Debt - When multiple issuers jointly raise capital for a project spanning their areas
C. Co-terminus Debt - When issuers tax the same property (e.g. city and county)
D. Overlapping Debt - Includes adjacent and co-terminus debt situations
E. State Debt - Does not overlap since states don't tax property

IV. Revenue Bond Features
A. Not subject to statutory debt limits (based on project revenues)
B. Trust Indentures with Covenants (promises to bondholders)
D. Moral Obligation Bonds - State can, but not legally obligated, to pay from taxes
E. Housing Authority Bonds - Backed by federal government if project revenues insufficient
**double-barreled=**
A double-barreled bond is a GO bond that is first backed by the full faith and credit and general revenues of the issuer, but can also rely on revenues of the project for payment of debt service. Because they can rely on two sources of funds for debt service, double barreled bonds are viewed as some of the safest municipal bonds.
V. Muni Bond Insurance

- Insurance company guarantees principal and interest payments if issuer defaults
- Insured bonds delivered with proof of insurance

VI. Investor Suitability

- Most suitable for investors in high tax brackets to benefit from tax-exemption
- For AMT payers, recommended public purpose munis over private activity munis

### Tax Swap and Wash Sale for the Series 7 Exam

**Tax Swap:**

**Definition:**
- A **tax swap** is a strategy used by investors to sell a security at a loss and purchase a similar, but not identical, security. The primary goal is to realize a capital loss for tax purposes while maintaining a similar investment position.

**Key Points:**
1. **Purpose:**
   - To realize a capital loss that can be used to offset capital gains and reduce taxable income.
   - To maintain an investment in the same sector or asset class.

2. **Execution:**
   - Sell a security that has decreased in value.
   - Purchase a similar security (not substantially identical) to maintain exposure to the market or sector.

3. **Rules:**
   - The securities involved in the swap should not be substantially identical to avoid wash sale rules.

4. **Example:**
   - Selling shares of one technology company at a loss and purchasing shares of another technology company with similar characteristics.

**Wash Sale:**

**Definition:**
- A **wash sale** occurs when an investor sells a security at a loss and repurchases the same or a substantially identical security within 30 days before or after the sale.

**Key Points:**
1. **Purpose:**
   - Often unintentional, the wash sale rule is designed to prevent investors from claiming a tax deduction for a security sold at a loss, only to repurchase the same or substantially identical security shortly thereafter.

2. **IRS Rule:**
   - The IRS disallows the capital loss deduction if the same or a substantially identical security is bought within 30 days before or after the sale.

3. **Substantially Identical:**
   - Includes not only the same security but also options or contracts to acquire the security, or securities that are convertible into the sold security.

4. **Holding Period:**
   - The holding period of the repurchased security includes the holding period of the original security.

5. **Disallowed Loss:**
   - The disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the repurchased security, effectively deferring the loss until the new security is sold.

6. **Example:**
   - Selling shares of a company at a loss on December 1st and buying back the same shares on December 20th. The loss cannot be claimed on that year's tax return.

### Summary for Series 7 Exam:

**Tax Swap:**
- Understand the concept of selling a security at a loss and purchasing a similar (but not substantially identical) security to maintain an investment position while realizing a tax loss.
- Recognize the importance of avoiding substantially identical securities to comply with IRS rules.

**Wash Sale:**
- Comprehend the wash sale rule and its implications on claiming tax losses.
- Identify what constitutes a substantially identical security and the 30-day period rule.
- Know the tax implications, including the disallowance of the loss and its adjustment to the cost basis of the repurchased security.

By understanding these concepts, candidates can effectively answer questions related to tax strategies and IRS rules on the Series 7 exam.


### Local Government Investment Pools (LGIPs)

**Definition:**
- LGIPs are equity securities similar to mutual funds. Investors own a proportionate share of the investment pool.

**Management:**
- The investment pool can be managed by government employees or an external investment firm.

**Purpose:**
- LGIPs were established to provide safe, liquid, and competitive investment options for cash held by municipalities.


- **Duration:**
  - **Definition:** A measurement of how long it will take for an investor to receive back their cash flows from a bond.
  - **Zero-Coupon Bonds:** Have a duration equal to their maturity. This is because the investor does not receive any interest payments until the bond's maturity date.
