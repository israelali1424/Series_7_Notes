Here are the key points about municipal bonds from the notes:

I. Types of Municipal Bonds
A. General Obligation Bonds (GO Bonds) - Used to finance non-revenue producing municipal projects (libraries, city halls etc.) - Repaid from general tax revenues of the municipality
B. Revenue Bonds - Used to finance revenue-producing projects (airports, bridges with tolls etc.) - Repaid from revenues generated by the project facility

II. Tax Treatment

- Municipal bond interest income is exempt from federal income tax
- If bonds are issued in-state, the interest is also exempt from state/local taxes ("triple tax-free")
- Capital gains on muni bond sales are still taxable

III. Key Terminology
A. Statutory Debt Limits - Limits on how much debt a municipality can issue, based on property value
B. Adjacent Debt - When multiple issuers jointly raise capital for a project spanning their areas
C. Co-terminus Debt - When issuers tax the same property (e.g. city and county)
D. Overlapping Debt - Includes adjacent and co-terminus debt situations
E. State Debt - Does not overlap since states don't tax property

IV. Revenue Bond Features
A. Not subject to statutory debt limits (based on project revenues)
B. Trust Indentures with Covenants (promises to bondholders)
C. Double-Barrel Bonds - Backed by project revenues and taxes
D. Moral Obligation Bonds - State can, but not legally obligated, to pay from taxes
E. Housing Authority Bonds - Backed by federal government if project revenues insufficient

V. Muni Bond Insurance

- Insurance company guarantees principal and interest payments if issuer defaults
- Insured bonds delivered with proof of insurance

VI. Investor Suitability

- Most suitable for investors in high tax brackets to benefit from tax-exemption
- For AMT payers, recommended public purpose munis over private activity munis
