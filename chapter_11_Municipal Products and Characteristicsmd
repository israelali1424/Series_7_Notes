Municipal Products and Characteristics
Study Guide: Municipal Bonds and Related Concepts

I. Municipal Bond Redemption and Sinking Funds

A. Facilitating Bond Redemption

- **Sinking fund** is used to facilitate bond redemption
- Definition: Money set aside periodically by issuer to redeem bonds
- Uses:
  • Call bonds
  • Redeem at maturity
  • Buy bonds in open market

B. Impact of Sinking Fund on Marketability

- Makes bonds **more marketable**
- Typically used by **lower-rated issuers**
- Provides assurance of repayment to investors

C. Registration Requirements

- Municipal bonds are **exempt from 33 Act registration**
- Also **exempt from state registration**
- Sinking fund does not affect registration status

II. Municipal Bond Interest Rates and Pricing

A. Variable/Floating Interest Rates

- Some municipal bonds can have variable or floating rates
- Known as **reset bonds**
- Interest rate resets against an index at fixed intervals
- Price remains stable due to constant adjustment to market rates

B. Build America Bonds (BABs)

- Pay **federally taxable interest income**
- Provide holders with a **federal tax credit** for taxes paid
- Suitable for all investors, not just high tax bracket investors

C. When-Issued Trading

- Interest rate is determined and included on trade confirmation
- Settlement date, accrued interest, and total cost are not known

III. Municipal Bond Types and Characteristics

A. General Obligation (GO) vs. Revenue Bonds

- GO Bonds considerations:
  • Debt per capita
  • Unfunded pension liabilities
  • Income taxes (state level)
  • Tax collection ratio
  • Overlapping debt
- Revenue Bonds considerations:
  • Feasibility study
  • Debt service coverage ratio (DSCR)

B. Trading and Quoting

- Primarily **over-the-counter dealer-to-dealer market**
- Limited liquidity due to buy-and-hold nature of investments
- Serial bonds quoted on **yield-to-maturity basis**
- Term bonds quoted as **percentage of par**
- **Nominal** or **subject** quotes are non-firm

C. Trading Specifications

- Round lot face amount: **$100,000**
- Individual bond par value: **$1,000**
- Use of brokers' brokers for anonymity
- Reporting to RTRS within 15 minutes (similar to TRACE for corporate bonds)

IV. Yield Calculations and Comparisons

A. Tax Equivalent Yield (TEY)

- Formula: TEY = Municipal Yield / (1 - Tax Bracket)
- Used to compare municipal bonds to taxable corporate bonds
- Example:
  • 4% municipal bond
  • 35% tax bracket: TEY = 4% / (1 - 0.35) = 6.2%
  • 10% tax bracket: TEY = 4% / (1 - 0.10) = 4.4%

B. Tax-Free Equivalent Yield

- Formula: Tax-Free Equivalent Yield = Corporate Yield × (1 - Tax Bracket)
- Used to find equivalent municipal bond yield for a given corporate bond
- Example:
  • 6% corporate bond
  • 35% tax bracket: 6% × (1 - 0.35) = 3.9%
  • 10% tax bracket: 6% × (1 - 0.10) = 5.4%

V. Auction Rate Securities (ARS)

A. Characteristics

- Long-term debt securities with periodically reset interest rates
- Interest rates tied to **short-term rates**
- Issued and rated as **long-term securities**
- Priced and traded like short-term bonds

B. Auction Process

- Auctioned at par value
- Interest rate set by **clearing rate** (lowest bid rate where all bonds can be sold)

C. Potential Issues

- Risk of failed auctions
- Default rates may not reflect market conditions in case of failed auctions

VI. Additional Municipal Bond Concepts

A. Brokers' Brokers

- Serve other municipal dealers and institutions
- Not for retail clients
- Used for dealer anonymity

B. Firm Quotes with Recall

- Example: "Held firm for one hour with a five-minute recall"
- Dealer promises fixed price for one hour
- Can remove fixed price with five-minute warning

C. Legal Opinions

- Municipal bonds can be delivered without legal opinions
- Must be marked "X legal" (excluding legal opinion) if no opinion provided
- No requirement for official statement due to exempt status

[End of Notes]

Thank you for providing that detailed lecture on mutual funds and related investment company topics. Here are some key points I've summarized from the content:

1. Mutual Fund Pricing:

   - Public Offering Price (POP) = Net Asset Value (NAV) + Sales Charge
   - Sales Charge % is always calculated as a percentage of POP, not NAV
   - When calculating POP from NAV and sales charge %, use: NAV / (1 - Sales Charge %)

2. Breakpoints:

   - Offer discounted sales charges for larger investments
   - Can be used by households, married couples, parents with minor children
   - Not available for investment clubs

3. Mutual Fund Transactions:

   - Dividend reinvestment usually has no sales charge but is still taxable
   - Unrealized gains (price appreciation) are not taxable until sold
   - Exchanges within a fund family typically have no sales charge but are taxable events

4. Bond Mutual Fund Volatility Ratings:

   - Assess sensitivity to market changes, especially interest rate risk
   - Cannot be called "risk ratings" for regulatory reasons
   - Funds with longer-term bonds typically have higher volatility ratings

5. Interval Funds:

   - Closed-end funds not traded on exchanges
   - Offer redemptions only at specific intervals (e.g. quarterly)
   - Priced at NAV during redemption periods

6. Business Development Companies (BDCs):
   - Closed-end funds that invest in developing or troubled small/mid-sized companies
   - Exchange-traded and available to both accredited and non-accredited investors
   - Must distribute 90% of income annually

Thank you for providing this detailed information on municipal bonds. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. Sinking Fund:

   - Facilitates bond redemption
   - Issuer sets aside money periodically
   - Can be used to call bonds, redeem at maturity, or buy bonds in the open market

2. Impact of Sinking Fund:

   - Makes bonds more marketable
   - Typically used by lower-rated issuers
   - Provides assurance to investors about repayment

3. Municipal Bond Registration:

   - Exempt from 33 Act registration
   - Exempt from state registration
   - Exemptions apply regardless of sinking fund presence

4. Variable/Floating Interest Rates:

   - Some municipal bonds can have variable or floating rates
   - Less common than fixed-rate bonds
   - Also known as "reset bonds"
   - Interest rate resets against an index at fixed intervals

5. Price Stability of Floating Rate Bonds:
   - Price stays relatively stable
   - Adjusts to market rates due to frequent resets

This information highlights the complexity of municipal bonds and the importance of understanding their various features for the Series 7 exam. The sinking fund concept, registration exemptions, and the possibility of variable interest rates are particularly important points to remember.
Here's the study guide in Markdown format:

# Municipal Bonds Study Guide

## I. Floating Rate vs. Fixed Rate Municipal Bonds

### Floating Rate Municipal Bonds (FRMBs):
- Interest rate adjusts periodically based on market rates
- **Benefit:** Maintains stable price as it reflects current market rates
- **Drawback:** Doesn't offer high initial interest rates like some fixed-rate bonds

### Fixed Rate Municipal Bonds:
- Interest rate is set at issuance and remains constant until maturity
- **Benefit:** May offer higher initial interest rates than FRMBs
- **Drawback:** Price can fluctuate if market rates change

## II. Build America Bonds (BABs)
- Taxable municipal bonds with a federal tax credit that offsets the federal tax liability on the interest earned
- **Benefit:** Makes them suitable for a wider range of investors, not just high-tax-bracket ones

## III. When-Issued Municipal Bonds
- Bonds sold before the official issuance date
- **Key Characteristic:** Interest rate is already determined while other details like settlement date and accrued interest are unknown

## IV. Municipal Bond Features Compared

| Feature | Revenue Bond | General Obligation (GO) Bond |
|---------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Debt per capita | Not a major concern | Important - impacts statutory debt limit |
| Unfunded pension liabilities | Important - competes for tax dollars used for bond service | Not a major concern |
| Income taxes | Not a major concern | Local municipalities rely on property taxes |

## V. Municipal Bond Trading
- Primarily conducted **over-the-counter (OTC)** between dealers, not on exchanges
- **Reasons for Lower Trading Activity:**
  - Investors buy for tax-free income, not capital appreciation
  - Municipal bonds are issued by many localities, reducing overall trading volume

## VI. Municipal Bond Quotes
- **Serial Bonds:** Quoted on a yield-to-maturity basis (longer maturity = higher yield)
- **Dollar Price Quotes:** Represent a percentage of par value
- **Nominal/Subject Quotes:** Not firm commitments to buy/sell at the quoted price

## VII. Municipal Bond Lot Sizes
- **Round Lot:** $100,000 (typically comprised of 100 $1,000 par value bonds)

## VIII. Broker Anonymity in Municipal Bond Trades
- Brokers used to hide investor identity in the OTC market
- Trades still reported to the Real-Time Reporting System (RTRS) within 15 minutes

## IX. Tax-Equivalent Yield Calculations
- Used to compare taxable corporate bond yields to tax-free municipal bond yields
- Formula: Municipal Yield / (1 - Tax Bracket) = Tax-Equivalent Yield

## X. Auction Rate Securities (ARS)
- Long-term debt securities with interest rates reset periodically through auctions
- Interest rates are tied to short-term rates

XI. Auction Rate Securities (ARS) - Continued

Issuance and Ratings: Issued and rated as long-term or short-term securities, although the interest rates are tied to short-term rates.

Pricing and Trading:

Auctioned at par value.
Interest paid is set by the clearing rate (lowest acceptable bid rate to sell all bonds).
Main Problem: Failed auctions with no clearing rate set, leading to default rates not reflecting market conditions.
XII. Municipal Bond Broker Roles

Primary Function: Serve other municipal bond dealers and institutions, not retail clients.
Anonymity: Used by dealers to hide client identities in the OTC market.
XIII. Firm Quotes for Municipal Bonds

Definition: A broker's promise to hold a specific price for a bond for a set time (usually one hour).
Recall Provision: Broker can withdraw the fixed price with a short notice (typically five minutes).
XIV. Sinking Funds for Municipal Bonds

Function: Money set aside annually to ensure sufficient funds are available to repay the principal at maturity.
Improves Bond Attractiveness: Signals a strong commitment to repayment.
XV. Legal Opinions for Municipal Bonds

Bond Counsel Opinion: Not mandatory for municipal bonds, but ensures compliance with statutory debt limits.
Delivery Without Legal Opinion: Allowed, but bonds must be marked "X legal" to disclose the absence of an opinion.

The lecture emphasizes the importance of understanding these concepts, especially newer products like interval funds and BDCs, for the Series 7 exam.
Thank you for the detailed lecture on municipal bond cost basis adjustments and related concepts. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. Premium Bonds:

   - Amortize premium over remaining life using straight-line method
   - Applies to both new issues and secondary market bonds
   - Amortization reduces cost basis annually
   - No tax implications for amortization (it's a loss)

2. Discount Bonds:

   - Accrete discount over remaining life using straight-line method
   - Applies to both new issues and secondary market bonds
   - Accretion increases cost basis annually
   - Tax implications differ for original issue discount (OID) vs. market discount

3. Original Issue Discount (OID):

   - Accretion is considered tax-exempt municipal bond interest
   - No taxes owed on annual accretion

4. Market Discount:

   - Accretion is taxable as ordinary income
   - Taxes owed on annual accretion

5. Capital Gains/Losses:

   - Calculated using adjusted cost basis at time of sale
   - Taxable even for municipal bonds

6. Bonds Held to Maturity:

   - No capital gain/loss at maturity
   - Adjusted basis should equal par value

7. Defeased Bonds:

   - Escrowed to maturity with government securities
   - No longer a liability for the municipality
   - Helps municipalities manage statutory debt limits

8. Municipal Bond Investment Objectives:

   - Typically buy and hold for tax-free interest income

9. Interest Accrual:
   - Begins on the dated date for new bond issues

These concepts, especially cost basis adjustments and tax implications, are important for the Series 7 exam and for understanding municipal bond investments.
**Direct debt**
Direct debt is all debt issued by the municipality, both general obligation and revenue. Short-term municipal notes are also included in the total.
