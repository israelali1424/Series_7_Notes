Based on the passage, here are the key points about the different types of equities covered:

I. Common Stock
   - Represents ownership in the company
   - Shares can appreciate or depreciate in value
   - Pays dividends at discretion of board of directors  
   - Provides voting rights to elect board members
   - If traded over-the-counter (OTC) and under $5/share, considered a **penny stock**

II. Preferred Stock
    - Also represents ownership, but different from common stock
    - Primary aim is to provide fixed stream of dividends (income production)
    - Typically no voting rights
    - Little focus on share appreciation
    - Can have features like cumulative, participating, callable etc.

III. Rights
    - Give shareholders short-term ability to purchase stock from issuer at set price
    - Issued with new securities offerings to avoid dilution of ownership
    - Also called preemptive rights or subscription rights

IV. Warrants  
    - Gives holder right to purchase common stock at fixed price
    - Long-term instruments, issued with another security like bonds
    - Considered an equity security  

V. American Depository Receipts (ADRs)
    - U.S. traded security representing shares in a foreign company
    - Provides exposure to international equities while trading domestically
    - Denominated in U.S. dollars
    - Carries currency risk and political risk from foreign market

    II. Preferred Stock
A. Participating Preferred
- Offers possibility of higher dividend than stated rate
- Holders can "participate" in company's growth/profits
B. Callable Preferred
- The issuer has the right to "call" or redeem the shares
- To compensate investors, callable preferred pays higher dividend rate
C. Convertible Preferred
- Prices will be closely linked to the issuer's common stock price
- Holders have the option to convert to common shares
III. Rights
- Issuing preemptive rights likely leads to decrease in earnings per share (EPS)
- If combined with a stock split, rights provide twice the shares at half the price post-split
IV. Warrants
- No additional details provided
V. ADRs
- Taxed in same manner as U.S. stocks for capital gains and dividends
- Foreign country may withhold taxes on dividends paid, for which U.S. holder gets a tax credit
